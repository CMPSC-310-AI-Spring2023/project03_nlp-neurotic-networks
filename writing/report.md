## Data

TODO: Describe the data used in your project and how you obtained it. Cite (provide a link to) any sources you have used.

## Text Generation

We followed the instructor provided tutorial [here, on Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation#build_the_model), making some adjustments where necessary. Those adjustments include (but aren't limited to) tweaking the process of collecting the input file, *heavily* increasing the number of training epochs, and adjusting the starting characters when creating a new prediction.

MODIFIED VERSION:
The story takes place in the future where the greenhouse gases have caused the polar icecaps to melt. The robot children give the bad news that the estimate of years is now down to days before the code will appear in video clips to make the black hole a trap.

## Supplemental Production

The supplemental production was created through the use of DALL-E. We asked for a movie poster for a movie about a climate disaster brought about by robot children. The stark yellow-and-black coloring and the pictured barren wasteland definitely convey the feeling we were hoping to see. The looming robot hand in the corner of the poster is a particularly nice touch.
