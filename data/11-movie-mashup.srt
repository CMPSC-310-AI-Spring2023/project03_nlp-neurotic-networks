[KNOCKING CONTINUES]

1231
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:20,274
David, I often felt a sort
of envy of humans...

1232
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:23,444
...of that thing they called spirit.

1233
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:27,865
Human beings had created a million
explanations of the meaning of life...

1234
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:30,660
...in art, poetry, mathematical formulas.

1235
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:35,123
Certainly human beings must be the key
to the meaning of existence.

1236
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:38,292
But human beings no longer existed.

1237
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:41,295
So we began a project...

1238
02:08:41,463 --> 02:08:45,383
...that would make it possible to re-create
the living body of a person long dead...

1239
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:49,846
...from the DNA in a fragment
of bone or mummified skin.

1240
02:08:50,097 --> 02:08:52,640
We also wondered,
would it be possible...

1241
02:08:52,808 --> 02:08:56,811
...to retrieve a memory trace
in resonance with a re-created body?

1242
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:59,355
And you know what we found?

1243
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:03,735
We found the very fabric
of space-time itself...

1244
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:07,155
...appeared to store information
about every event...

1245

...which had ever occurred in the past.

1246
02:09:11,201 --> 02:09:15,371
But the experiment was a failure.

1247
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:20,752
Those who were resurrected only lived
through a single day of renewed life.

1248
02:09:21,545 --> 02:09:25,673
When the resurrectees fell asleep
on the night of their first new day...

1249
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,884
...they died again.

1250
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:32,054
As soon as they became unconscious,
their very existence...

1251
02:09:32,264 --> 02:09:34,849
...faded away into darkness.

1252
02:09:35,058 --> 02:09:38,186
So you see, David,
the equations had shown...

1253
02:09:38,395 --> 02:09:42,732
...that once an individual space-time
pathway had been used...

1254

00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm meat. Y'all asses meat.

41
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,963
Everything is part of the buffet
of the universe.

42
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,032
This here is an aurochs...

43
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,268
a fierce, mean creature
that walked the face of the earth...

44
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,471
back when we all lived in the caves.

45
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,446
And they would gobble them
cave-babies down...

46
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,211
right in front of the cave-baby parents.

47
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,118
And the cavemans,
they couldn't even do nothing about it...

48
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,089
because they was too poor
and too small.

49
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,489
Who up in here think
that the cavemans...

50
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,655
was sitting around crying
like a bunch of pussies?

51
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,236
Y'all better think about that
because any day now...

52
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,397
fabric of the universe
is coming unraveled.

53
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,806
Ice caps gonna melt,
water is gonna rise...

54
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,539
and everything south of the levee
is going under.

55
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,342
Y'all better learn how to survive now.

56
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,595
<i>Way back in the day...</i>

57
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,357
<i>the aurochs was king of the world.</i>

58
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:55,532
<i>If it wasn't for giant snowballs
and the Iced Age...</i>

59
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,606
<i>I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy.</i>

60
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,107
<i>I would just be breakfast.</i>

61
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,576
Daddy?

62
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,112
Feed up time.

63
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,071
Feed up time.

64
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,319
Daddy?

65
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,150
Daddy!

66
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:20,583
<i>Kids that got no mama,
no daddy and nobody...</i>

67
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,126
<i>they gots to live in the woods...</i>

68
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,322
<i>and eat grass and steal underpants.</i>

69
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,336
<i>If Daddy don't get back soon...</i>

70
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,670
<i>it's gonna be time for me
to start eating my pets.</i>

71
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,971
Daddy?

72
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,140
Daddy?

73
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,250
- That taste good?
- Yeah.

74
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,899
Hey, my baby, you need a ride?

75
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,469
No, my dad come and pick me up.

76
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,970
Well, what about some food
or something, darling?

77
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,699
You hungry?

78
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,937
All right, then.
Well, suit yourself, okay?

79
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,146
<i>Everything we still got from Mama,
I keep in my house.</i>

80
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,392
<i>Daddy says the first time
she looked at me...</i>

81
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,893
<i>it made her heart beat so big...</i>

82
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,361
<i>that she thought it would blow up.</i>

83
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,865
<i>That's why she swam away.</i>

84
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,741
<i>Hi, my sweet baby.</i>

85
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,076
Hi, Mama.

86
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,591
<i>Hushpuppy, what you doing there?</i>

87
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,775
<i>You being good like I taught you?</i>

88
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,707
Yes, Mama.

89
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,600
<i>You're good</i>

90
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,800
<i>You make me happy</i>

91
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,743
<i>You're good</i>

92
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,041
<i>You make me happy</i>

93
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,411
<i>You're good</i>

94
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,143
That's pretty, Ma.

95
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,288
<i>You're pretty, Hushpuppy.</i>

96
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,385
Get out of my way, you fat animal.

97
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,855
Daddy.

98
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892
Daddy! Daddy!

99
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,576
I learned lots of things
while you were gone.

100
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:05,437
If I drink all this here,
I can burp like a man.

101
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,927
- Why are you wearing that dress?
- Leave me alone, man.

102
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,026
You wearing a bracelet too?

103
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,672
Go to your house.
You wouldn't understand.

104
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,836
- I want to come to your house.
- Get out of here!

105
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,380
- I want to come--
- Go ahead!

106
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,033
Get down from there.
Get over here.

107
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,313
Feed up time!
Come on, man! Feed up!

108
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,807
Boss lady!

109
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,142
Hushpuppy, where you at?

110
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,080
Where you at, boss lady?

111
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,380
<i>If Daddy kill me,
I ain't gonna be forgotten.</i>

112
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,290
<i>I'm recording my story
for the scientists in the future.</i>

113
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,358
<i>In a million years,
when kids go to school...</i>

114
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,002
<i>they're gonna know, once,
there was a Hushpuppy...</i>

115
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,934
<i>and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.</i>

116
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,238
Hushpuppy!

117
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,211
Where you at, man?

118
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,082
Hushpuppy!

119
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,742
Boss lady, goddamn it!

120
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,291
Come here!

121
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,056
Don't you run away from me!

122
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,221
I swear to God!

123
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,298
Get your ass back here!

124
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,270
I'm tearing off!

125
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,136
I'm tearing off just like my mama!

126
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,609
I'm gonna bust your ass!
Come here!

127
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,213
- Come here!
- No!

128
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,280
See what happen.
See what happen to you.

129
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,473
No!

130
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,860
I got to worry about you all the damn time!
You killing me!

131
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,059
You killing me!

132
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,161
Get up and now come on!

133
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,027
I hope you die.

134
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:54,343
And after you die, I'll go to your grave
and eat birthday cake all by myself.

135
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,396
Mama, I think I broke something.

136
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,305
Get over here!
Come on, let's go! Come on!

137
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,644
Miss Bathsheeba!

138
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,713
My daddy fell down.

139
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,655
Oh, God. Come on, baby.

140
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,255
Be okay.

141
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,935
Hushpuppy, take this medicine.
You run fast as you can. Go.

142
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,807
<i>Daddy could've turned into a tree.</i>

143
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,673
<i>Or a bug.</i>

144
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,913
<i>There wasn't any way to know.</i>

145
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,531
<i>The whole universe...</i>

146
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,299
<i>depends on everything
fitting together just right.</i>

147
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,140
<i>If one piece busts,
even the smallest piece...</i>

148
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,412
<i>the entire universe will get busted.</i>

149
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,679
The storm's coming! The storm's coming!

150
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,083
The storm is coming!

151
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,781
The storm is coming!

152
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,788
Hey, Walter. What it is?
Afraid of a little water?

153
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,894
I ain't messing with you, Wink.
I'm getting out of here.

154
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,223
You can stay if you want,
but I'm out.

155
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, now. What's up?

156
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,658
Look at these assholes...

157
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,395
running around all over the damn place.
<i>C'est la vie,</i> assholes.

158
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,267
- Hey.
- Ho! There's my boy, Wink!

159
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,670
- We gonna do this storm?
- Let me tell you.

160
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,004
These assholes go up and down here
all day long.

161
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,410
- That's what I'm talking about.
- We ain't leaving. I'm behind you.

162
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,744
- Man, I don't mind telling you, I am scared.
- Just leave.

163
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,682
- This ain't no little one.
- Damn pussy.

164
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,822
I'm leaving here
soon as I finish my beer.

165
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,551
No, you're not. You're gonna stay here with me.
I'll see you tomorrow, Walrus.

166
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,161
- Y'all want to die, okay, fine.
- Look at Winston.

167
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,661
Winston, I know you with me, huh, man?

168
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,460
What you gonna do
about the storm, man?

169
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,832
- Hey, Hushpuppy.
- Hushpuppy?

170
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,439
Get that girl a beer.

171
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,371
Where you been?

172
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,605
- What happened to you?
- Shut up.

173
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,906
You don't talk.

174
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,991
Come here!

175
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,786
Come here, ugly!

176
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,772
Just because you burnt
your house down...

177
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,467
don't mean you can walk in here
and take over.

178
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,613
This side of the house
is still Wink's side.

179
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,682
No toys, no girl stuff over here.

180
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,649
And if I want to come over there
and smack you in the face...

181
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,880
that's against the rules,
so that's a plus for you.

182
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,252
So come on down here
and get in the boat.

183
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,553
Come on, get in the boat!

184
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,891
Get in the boat.

185
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:56,372
And if the water gets real high,
we're gonna float to this roof...

186
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,271
we're gonna bust through the ceiling
and we're gonna ride away, okay?

187
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:08,043
Now I want you to put these on, okay?
Slide your arm through here.

188
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,710
Don't you never, never take these off.

189
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,256
I'm your daddy and you're gonna do
what I tell you to do...

190
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,519
because it's my job
to keep you from dying, okay?

191
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,061
So sit back and listen to me.

192
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,096
And close your eyes.

193
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,201
Go to sleep.

194
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,463
Go to sleep!

195
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,197
Why you staring at me like that?

196
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,031
How I'm supposed to sleep
with you staring at me like that?

197
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,073
What, you scared?

198
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,509
I'm gonna show you,
no storm can't beat no Doucet.

199
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,708
We Doucets.
We not scared of no damn storm!

200
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,821
I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna take care of that storm.

201
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,015
I'm coming to get you, storm!

202
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,196
Look at me! Look at me, Hushpuppy!

203
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,273
Look at me whip butt!
Come on, storm!

204
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,568
Come on!

205
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,609
I'm gonna get you!

206
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,680
Come on, I'm right here!

207
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,182
I'm right here! Yeah!

208
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,618
Yeah! Yeah!

209
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,390
Mama!

210
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,505
Mama?

211
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,983
<i>For the animals that didn't have a dad
to put them in a boat...</i>

212
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,288
<i>the end of the world already happened.</i>

213
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,203
Winston!

214
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,336
Yo, Winston!

215
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,654
<i>They're all down below,
trying to breathe through water.</i>

216
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,021
Yo, Edison, you in here?

217
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,309
Someday, when I'm gone,
you gonna be the last man in the Bathtub.

218
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,848
You're gonna have to learn
how to feed yourself.

219
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,816
Now stick your hand in this water.

220
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,751
Stick it in there.

221
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,253
Okay, what you do is
you hold your hand steady...

222
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,559
and you just wait on your fish to come.

223
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,042
You gotta ball your fist up, okay?
That's your punching hand.

224
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,976
Ball your fist up, case you have
to whack him when he come out.

225
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,052
All right, all right.

226
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,921
Oh, got it, got it!

227
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,728
Yeah! Oh, Lord!

228
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,098
Look what we got!
Look what we got!

229
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,797
Gotcha. We got it! Say, "I gotcha!"

230
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,635
- I gotcha!
- Yeah!

231
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,908
Hold him down.
You hold him down like this...

232
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,104
and you whack him good
with your fist.

233
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,978
Go ahead, whack him!
You whack him good.

234
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,676
Hold him like that and whack him.
Hold it.

235
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,616
Don't worry about that.
That's all a part of it.

236
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,887
Come on, you want to try it again?

237
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,158
Come on, one more time.

238
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,411
Mama?

239
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,621
Is that you?

240
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,266
I've broken everything.

241
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:40,225
<i>Strong animals know
when your heart is weak.</i>

242
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:46,129
<i>That makes them hungry,
and they start coming.</i>

243
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,786
Yo, Walrus.

244
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,590
Hey, man.

245
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,365
Come on, I gotcha. All right, partner.
I knew you wasn't gonna leave.

246
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,579
I must've passed out.

247
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,649
Little Jo.

248
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,583
- Hey.
- You okay, huh?

249
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,849
What happened to you? Get up.
Come on.

250
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:48,297
He been talking all night long
how it's the last night on earth.

251
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,730
- Don't worry about him.
- Trying to touch my titties and shit...

252
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,165
right in front of Peter T over there.

253
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,430
- Oh, Peter T, my man.
- Hello.

254
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,234
Good to see you, man!
I knew you wasn't gonna leave me.

255
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,970
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- That's one classic dude right there.

256
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,772
You a titan, man.

257
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,313
Yeah! Glad you stayed, man.

258
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,046
If I had a pair of wings,
I know I could have flown in that bad boy.

259
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,954
Almost blew off Walrus' panties.

260
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,322
But I would probably
have bounced off a tree.

261
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,629
Hushpuppy.

262
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,608
Did I ever tell you the story
about your conception?

263
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,039
Jesus.

264
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:43,045
One day, when me and Hushpuppy mama first met...

265
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,654
we were so shy,
we used to sit around...

266
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:51,021
and drink beer and smile at each other.

267
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,490
One day, I got so shy, I just napped.

268
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,260
<i>Back when Daddy used to talk about Mama...</i>

269
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:40,769
<i>he said she was so pretty,
she never even had to turn on the stove.</i>

270
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,310
<i>She'd just walk into the room...</i>

271
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,075
<i>and all the water starts to boil.</i>

272
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:10,399
Your mama battered that gator up
and set it to frying.

273
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:18,944
And Hushpuppy popped into the universe
about four minutes later.

274
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,188
I got it under control.

275
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,113
Miss Bathsheeba!

276
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,019
Come on, y'all.
Come on, girlie! Come on!

277
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,716
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

278
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,656
- That's it.
- Thank you.

279
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,728
- Thank you. Very nice.
- Look what we got.

280
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,525
We got the fresh catch today.
You like that, babe?

281
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,326
Yeah! Come on!

282
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,561
Come on, children,
I got some for y'all too.

283
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,172
Yeah! Let's go. Time to eat.

284
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:34,249
<i>For the ones we never find,
we make a funeral the Bathtub way.</i>

285
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,318
Yeah, tastes like more.
Come on. All right.

286
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,477
<i>With no crying allowed.</i>

287
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,917
Yes, to the water!

288
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,651
Come on, boy! Come on!

289
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,228
Pick that goddamn thing up!
Let's go!

290
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,490
Okay.

291
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,765
So I say to myself...

292
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,599
I'm gonna pee in my pants just a little.
Hell, when the water goes down...

293
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,003
I'm gonna French kiss the dirt.

294
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,235
The water ain't going down, man.

295
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,142
That's my beautiful place
under that water.

296
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,942
Everything beautiful is gone.

297
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,314
Man, you know they got salt in that water,
done ate everything up.

298
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,149
Trees are gonna die first,
then the animals, then the fish.

299
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,522
You gotta think about moving.

300
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,630
I got it under control.

301
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,433
Come here, Hushpuppy.
Come sit by your Uncle Jean.

302
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,300
Let me show you how to do this.
Here. Here, baby.

303
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,269
Don't be scared of it, now.
Now, turn it upside-down.

304
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,708
There you go.
Now, push it with your thumb.

305
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,210
Good girl. That's it.

306
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:45,445
And then, real careful,
take this knife and you pop this off.

307
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,821
That's beautiful.

308
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,155
No, Hushpuppy!

309
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,161
Beast it.

310
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,767
Beast it!

311
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,463
Show me you can do it!

312
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,506
- Come on, I know you can do it.
- Come on!

313
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,769
- Beast it!
- Come on, now!

314
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,573
Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!

315
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,148
<i>Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!</i>

316
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,375
Beast it. Beast it.

317
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,756
Come on, now! Beast it!

318
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,685
Yeah!

319
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,195
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

320
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,765
You see what kind of family we got?
We got feeling!

321
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,607
You're an animal!

322
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,946
Yeah, you're an animal. Yeah.

323
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,021
Yeah!

324
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,495
<i>It wasn't no time to sit around
crying like a bunch of pussies.</i>

325
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,010
<i>We're gonna make a camp
right on top of the Bathtub.</i>

326
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,751
<i>We got enough animals to eat
until the water goes down.</i>

327
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,136
Like this.

328
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,303
Smoother. Gentler.

329
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,703
Yeah, that's right. Right there.

330
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,572
It's gonna be all right.

331
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,804
Okay. Okay.

332
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,815
That's the most important thing
I can ever teach y'all.

333
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,653
Y'all got to learn how to take care of people
smaller and sweeter than you are.

334
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,327
You got it.

335
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,859
You okay?

336
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,384
<i>Two weeks later,
everything started to die.</i>

337
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,242
Got to get something out of this water.

338
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:51,321
Walrus, you want to leave the Bathtub?

339
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,859
No.

340
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,258
I heard that.

341
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,699
Nobody is leaving the Bathtub.

342
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,535
You don't know nothing.

343
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:15,713
This water gonna kill us here.
We gotta do something about this.

344
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:21,422
I ain't starving to death while them people
going grocery shopping and all that.

345
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,711
Shit. Son of a....

346
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,892
Boss, Daddy got to go
take care of something.

347
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,432
I'm gonna fix everything the way it was.

348
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,663
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry. I'm the man.

349
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,671
We gonna win.

350
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,334
And if anything go wrong,
Walrus is daddy.

351
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,185
You gonna be the king of the Bathtub.
I promise that.

352
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,721
Just sit right there. I'll be back.

353
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,546
I think they be gone.
I really can't say where.

354
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,808
What are you talking about?
They go to the levee?

355
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,282
- Ain't no problem.
- Don't make me slap your ass!

356
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:01,014
You so much as piss on that wall,
you know what them people gonna do?

357
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,556
They gonna find us
and stick us in a damn shelter.

358
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,896
<i>Daddy says brave men don't run
from their home.</i>

359
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,627
Peter T, hold onto the boat.
You're gonna be fine.

360
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:38,086
Peter T, you hold the trip wire. Okay?

361
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,163
- Get the line over there.
- Okay.

362
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:08,552
<i>The entire universe depends on
everything fitting together just right.</i>

363
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,555
<i>If you can fix the broken piece,
everything can go right back.</i>

364
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,129
Come on, baby!

365
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,873
Peter T...

366
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,147
hand me that trip wire.

367
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,753
I'm so sorry, but....

368
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,220
Peter T, you drop the trip wire?

369
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,017
Well, yes, I did.

370
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,685
- Peter T.
- I gotta go find it.

371
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,472
Get over here!

372
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,202
What are you doing, woman? 

373
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,314
I'm hauling your ass home, little boy.

374
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,847
Get off!

375
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,985
Touch that wall,
they gonna come after us.

376
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,517
You don't know nothing!

377
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,450
Jean Battiste! Get the trip line!

378
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,351
Get in the boat!
Get your ass in here!

379
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,385
Hushpuppy!

380
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,262
Pull!

381
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,538
- Pull, pull!
- Now, boss!

382
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,977
- Now, boss!
- No!

383
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,758
<i>It didn't matter
that the water was gone.</i>

384
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,726
<i>Sometimes you can break something so bad...</i>

385
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,797
<i>that it can't get put back together.</i>

386
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,019
Mama!

387
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,366
Mama!

388
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:19,238
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation area.
You can no longer live here.</i> 

389
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:28,612
<i>I repeat, this is a mandatory evacuation area.</i>

390
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,566
<i>When you're small,
you gotta fix what you can.</i>

391
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,203
Goddamn!

392
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,829
What the hell wrong with you?
What you doing?

393
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,204
What you gonna do now, huh?

394
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:41,012
Oh, you want to throw things, huh?
All right, I can do that too.

395
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,453
Come on, then.
You want to play the game?

396
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,219
Come on, let's throw stuff. Come on!

397
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,863
I can do that too! So come on.

398
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,659
You want to throw stuff? Come on!

399
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:54,530
Come on. 

400
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,194
Come on!

401
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,575
Gotcha. Come on, come on!

402
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:09,211
Gotcha. Come on! Come on! 

403
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,874
Come on.

404
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,642
Man, you think I don't know.

405
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,148
You think I can't see?

406
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,048
No crying.

407
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,091
No crying, man! Hey!

408
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:59,233
Goddamn it, I said no crying!

409
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,923
Come on, get a drink.

410
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:57,315
This counts as I'm sorry
for a whole bunch of things, Lord.

411
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,872
You gonna be dead?

412
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,372
No.

413
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,972
You gonna leave me alone?

414
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,677
No, I ain't gonna leave you alone.

415
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,716
Because if you be gone,
I be gone too.

416
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,319
No, that's not how it work.

417
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,685
Sometimes in the bed...

418
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:34,192
I start to shake and I can't stop.
I got what you got.

419
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,230
No, that's just a side effect
of you being a stupid little girl.

420
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,998
I ain't gonna be dead?

421
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,161
No, you'll probably live
a hundred years more.

422
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,769
Come on, let me see them guns.
Come on. Show me them guns.

423
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,676
Let me see them.
Come on, show them to me.

424
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,245
Show them to me.
Show me them guns!

425
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,977
Show them to me! Guns!

426
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,816
Guns! Guns! Guns!

427
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,982
Gun! Guns! Come on. Come on.

428
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,151
Come on!

429
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,159
Come on! Let me have it!

430
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,831
You the man! Who the man?

431
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,768
- I'm the man.
- Yeah, you the man!

432
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,839
- Who the man?
- I'm the man!

433
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,977
- You the man! Who the man?
- I'm the man.

434
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,545
- I'm the man! I'm the man!
- Yeah, you the man! Fuck this table. Shit!

435
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,057
I got to go lay down.

436
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,154
I got to get strong.

437
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,128
Don't be scared.

438
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,338
What?

439
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,644
Come on.

440
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,461
Lay down.

441
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,831
- Hey.
- Yeah?

442
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,925
You ain't the one that's sick.

443
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,244
<i>Strong animals got no mercy.</i>

444
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,578
<i>They're the type of animals...</i>

445
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,656
<i>that eat their own mamas and daddies.</i>

446
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,809
- Think someone is in there?
- I don't know. This is a freaking shack.

447
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,845
Go check around the back.

448
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:17,216
There's no one in there.
Look at this place.

449
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,516
- Will you please open the door?
- Get back.

450
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,217
This is a mandatory evacuation area.

451
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,396
Everyone in this region has to leave.

452
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,691
We ain't going nowhere!

453
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,794
Sir, we have food and shelter.

454
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,629
- Kick it in.
- Go around the back.

455
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,203
Let's go. Get in there.

456
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,771
Just remain calm.

457
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,238
Son, you want me to cancel
your birth certificate?

458
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,934
- Grab her arm!
- Son of a bitch!

459
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,206
- Get your hands off of me!
- Hold her down. Hold her down!

460
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,941
- Stay down, sir.
- Stay down!

461
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:53,246
- Let her go! I'm gonna kill you!
- You have her?

462
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,752
Let her go!

463
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,288
- Keep still.
- Let her go!

464
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,680
<i>It didn't look like a prison.</i>

465
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:23,215
<i>It looked more like a fish tank
with no water.</i>

466
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,555
<i>They said that we were here
for our own good.</i>

467
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,197
You're supposed to hear me!
I want an answer!

468
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:42,495
I don't have an answer.
The doctor is gonna have to give you that.

469
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:47,766
Don't eat that, hear?

470
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,974
Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you?

471
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,275
We found something in your test.

472
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,975
- It's urgent--
- Whoa, whoa. Not in front of my kid. 

473
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,018
Stay there, Hushpuppy.

474
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,679
- The procedure is--
- I said not in front of my kid.

475
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,518
The procedure is very risky.

476
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,320
There's really no way to guarantee
it will be successful.

477
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,190
In case anything happens....

478
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,165
- Get your hands off me.
- If we don't do this, you could die.

479
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,841
- I tell you! I don't need nothing from you!
- Hey, stop it!

480
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,141
- Mr. Doucet, calm down!
- Stop it! Come here.

481
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,842
I tell you! I tell you!
You don't tell me!

482
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:35,114
- Calm down!
- Let me go! Get your hands off me!

483
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,383
I don't need nothing from y'all.
Let me go!

484
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:38,958
Wink!

485
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,595
- Leave her alone!
- Let go of me!

486
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:42,855
Stop it!

487
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,563
Get off of me!

488
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,223
Daddy!

489
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:53,398
You're gonna have time-out.
Are you even listening to me?

490
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,485
<i>When an animal gets sick here...</i>

491
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,986
<i>they plug it into the wall.</i>

492
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,612
They're coming for you.

493
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,510
<i>Daddy used to say that
if he ever got so old...</i>

494
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,620
<i>he couldn't drink beer
and catch catfish...</i>

495
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,485
<i>then I had to put him in the boat
and set him on fire...</i>

496
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,786
<i>so no one could come plug him
into the wall.</i>

497
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,585
Dave.

498
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,994
Dave, help me out. Help me out.

499
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,236
Boss.

500
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,309
Get up. We busting out of here.

501
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,911
Come on.

502
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,788
Wait, there's a person out there.

503
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,284
Here you go.

504
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,030
Hey! Go home!

505
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,197
Come on, let's go!
Everybody get out!

506
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,975
Wait, wait, wait.

507
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,378
Let's go! Let's go!

508
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:45,299
- Make sure you put her somewhere good.
- Let me out of here! No! No!

509
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,031
Let me go!

510
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,140
- Let me off!
- Get off me!

511
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,818
You're trying to get rid of me!
You're trying to get rid of me!

512
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,684
Listen to me.
I'm not trying to get rid of you.

513
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,485
- Yes, you is.
- You don't understand!

514
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,721
I can't take care of you no more,
you understand?

515
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,558
I'm dying!

516
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,169
My blood is eating itself.

517
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,635
You know what that mean?

518
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:24,868
Don't be saying things about dying.

519
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:29,706
- Everybody daddies die.
- Not my daddy.

520
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,749
Yeah, your daddy.

521
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,392
I didn't want you to watch that, okay?

522
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,454
You understand?

523
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,700
Come on, let's go!

524
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,278
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here! Come on!

525
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,415
Come on, let's go!

526
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,579
Wait, wait, wait.

527
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,415
- Back up, back up.
- Girls, get back.

528
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:12,923
- Dad! Come on! Come on!
- Give him room to breathe.

529
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,094
Walrus, get me home.

530
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,216
<i>Everybody loses the thing
that made them.</i>

531
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:15,080
<i>It's even how it's supposed
to be in nature.</i>

532
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,687
<i>The brave men stay
and watch it happen.</i>

533
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,789
<i>They don't run.</i>

534
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,011
Come on!

535
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,324
I'm going by my mom.

536
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,524
That's a good place to go.

537
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,922
Which way are we going?

538
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,117
It don't matter, baby.

539
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,388
This boat will take you
exactly where you need to be.

540
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,726
It's that kind of boat.

541
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,834
Want a chicken biscuit?

542
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,465
They're good for you.

543
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,704
I've been eating these all my life.

544
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:59,677
I keep the wrappers in the boat
because they remind me of who I was...

545
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,719
when I ate each one.

546
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,950
The smell makes me feel cohesive.

547
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:09,088
I want to be cohesive.

548
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:12,630
I'm sure you will, baby.
No doubt in my mind.

549
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,787
Oh, hi.

550
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:15,121
Sergeant Major, how are you doing?

551
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,195
Hey, Miss Frankie.

552
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,688
Holy crap. You have toddlers.

553
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:23,496
- A whole litter of them.
- Oh, they are so cute.

554
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,679
They're so cute.

555
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,373

564
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,227
Let me tell you something.

565
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,561
When you're a child,
people say that life...

566
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,500
is gonna be happy and hunky-dory
and all that bullshit...

567
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:43,131
but I'm here to tell you that it's not,
so you need to get that out your head right now.

568
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,336
Because, yeah, life is some
big old feast, but you...

569
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,275
ain't nothing but a stupid little waitress.

570
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:54,049
One day, everything on your plate
gonna fall on the floor.

571
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,151
And nobody gonna be there
to pick it up for you.

572
01:16:57,312 --> 01:17:01,055
One day, it's gonna be all on you.

573
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,790
You understand what I'm saying?

574
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:11,666
So smile, girl.

575
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:15,535
Smile.

576
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:20,570

a pity-party-having-ass woman.

577
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,452

578
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,012

579
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,277

580
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,490

581
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:06,819

<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

585
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,965

595
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,233
All right, fatso, breathe some air.

596
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,579
I need to go home.

597

601
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,691
Real good.

602
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,241
No crying, hear?

603
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,949
No crying.

604
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,468
Don't you cry.

605
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:14,843
As I stand by the bayou,
I watch a ship as she disappears.

606
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,448
There, she is gone.

607
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,084
And we cry for this.

608
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,947
But she's not gone.

609
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,818
She's just as real as when she left me.

610
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:28,188
And somewhere else,
other voices are calling out:

611
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,953
"Here she comes."

612
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:32,291
And that is dying.

613
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:35,366

614

<i>Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming
can trigger a cooling trend.</i>

36
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,408
Let me explain.

37
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:53,288
The northern hemisphere owes its temperate
climate to the North Atlantic current.

38
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,667
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

39
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:03,465
<i>But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.</i>

40
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,467
Eventually,
it will shut down.

41
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,346
And when that occurs,
there goes our warm climate.

42
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,017
Excuse me. When do you think
this could happen, Professor?

43
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,019
- When?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

44
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,021
Maybe in a hundred years.
Maybe in a thousand.

45
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,815
But what I do know is
that if we do not act soon...

46
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,861
it is our children and our grandchildren
who will have to pay the price.

47
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,658
And who's going to pay
the price of the Kyoto Accord?

48
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,620
It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

<i><font color="#bce4f3">BOOKER:</font> We have to consider

393
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,043
The only force strong enough
to affect global weather is the sun.

394
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:04,923
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked. Solar output is normal.

395
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:10,095
- What about the North Atlantic current?
<i>- <font color="#bce4f3">VORSTEEN:</font> What about it?</i>

396
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,974
I got a call last night from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

397
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,976
He thinks the current
has changed.

398

<font color="#6088d2">[MURMURING]</font>

399
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,355
Come on, Jack.
How could that be?

400
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,400
The current depends upon
a delicate balance of salt and fresh water.

401
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,695
- We all know that.
- Yes.

402
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,864
But no one has
taken into account...

403
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,285
how much fresh water has been dumped
into the ocean because of melting polar ice.

404
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,121
I think we've hit
a critical desalinization point.

406
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,169
It would explain
what's driving this extreme weather.

407
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,172
Hedland had some pretty
convincing data.

408
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:49,217
They've asked me to feed it into my paleoclimate
model to track the next set of events.

409
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,971
<i>Hold on, Jack. Are you suggesting these
weather anomalies are gonna continue?</i>

410
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,057
Not just continue...
get worse.

411
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,731
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

the administration?</i>

414
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,866
What do you expect me
to tell them?

415
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,660
The government has to start making
long-term preparations now.

416

- Jack, all you have is a theory.
- Then give me the mainframe

Walk with me.

422
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,971
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

423
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,766
The hail, the tornadoes...
it all fits.

424
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,352
Can the model you're working on
factor in storm scenarios?

425
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,939
- Oh, we haven't had the time.
- Maybe I can help.

426
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,982
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

Yeah, the treatment

436
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:25,772
No, but I remember
the story from the pictures.

437
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,484
- You do?
- My mother used to read it to me.

438
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:33,989

Jack, were you able
to re-create the thermal cycle?

679
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:08,792
Yes. The storm's rotation is pulling super-cooled
air down from the upper troposphere.

00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,841
<i>But shouldn't the air warm up

they go?

817

The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

818
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:47,991
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't flooded.
Mexico would be best.

819
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:52,162
<i>Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science

<i>Well, we tried that approach. You didn't
want to hear about the science...</i>

have made a difference.

822
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:02,672
What exactly are you
proposing, Professor?

823
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:13,350
Evacuate everyone
south of that line.

824
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,358
What about the people
in the north?

825

I'm afraid
it's too late for them.

826
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:30,950
If they go outside,
the storm will kill them.

<i>At this point...</i>

828
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,417

You too.

836
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,692
We're all gonna need it.

837
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,781
We can't evacuate
half the country...

838
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,575
because one scientist
thinks the climate is shifting.

839
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,245
<i>Every minute we delay
is costing lives.</i>

840
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,455
What about the other
half of the country?

841
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:21,751
If Professor Hall is right, sending troops north
will create more victims.

842
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,046
<i>We need to save the people
we can right now.</i>

843
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,966
<i>We take the same approach
in triage on the battlefield.</i>

844
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,760
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices!

845
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,805
I don't accept that abandoning
half of the country is necessary.

Maybe if you would've listened
to him sooner, it wouldn't be.

01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:05,547
<i>Jack!
It's good to see you!</i>

1323
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:08,258
Come on.
Let's go get on board.

1324
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:05,232
Look at that.

1325
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:07,317
What?

1326
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:10,404
Have you ever seen the air
so clear?


1
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,375
God damn it.

2
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,791
<i>Inside the room,
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom, bam!</i>

3
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,666
<i>I slam</i>

4
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>Scream like Tarzan</i>

5
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,458
<i>I be tossin' and flossin',
my style is awesome</i>

6
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,333
<i>I'm causing more family feuds
than Richard Dawson</i>

7
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,291
<i>And the survey said, you're dead</i>

8
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>Fatal Flying Guillotine
chops off your fucking head</i>

9
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,250
<i>Mister, who is that?
Ayo, the Wu is back</i>

10
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,833
<i>Making... go Bo! Bo!
Like I'm Super Cat</i>

11
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,166
<i>Oh, no, here come
the Wu-Tang shogun</i>

12
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,375
<i>Killer to my eardrum,
put the needle to the groove</i>

13
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,666
<i>I gets rude and I'm forced
to fuck it up, my style...</i>

14
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,791
<i>More Afro than Rollo
coming to a fork in the road</i>

15
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,250
<i>Which way to go, just follow...</i>

16
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,541
This is nuts! This is so crazy!

17
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,791
I've got a hard cider
and a bag of Crossbone Crunch.

18
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,791
It's a party.

19
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,791
I'm... I'm just so,
so thrilled for you, Kate.

20
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,416
To Comet Dibiasky, right?
Cheers!

21
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,916
It's gotta be, look...
It's gotta be an Oort cloud comet

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,833
just based on where you saw it.

23
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,083
Probably the last time
it was this close to the Sun

24
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
was long before human civilization.

25
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,541
Look at the arc on that thing.
God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,083
How would we find out the comet's
velocity in orbit, Professor Mindy?

27
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,250
That is a good question.

28
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,166
This will be fun. I haven't done
orbital dynamics since grad school.

29
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,000
Question is, what...

30
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,375
What would Carl Sagan do?

31
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,875
He would take it back to first principles.

32
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,666
The topocentric vector is rho.

33
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,500
Kate, what are the initial coordinates?

34
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,000
Twenty-one.

35
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,875
Twenty-four.

36
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,500
Thirteen.

37
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,250
This is fun, huh, guys?

38
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,458
- Sixty-seven.
- Now you got me pumped.

39
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,791
- Dr. Mindy.
- All right...

40
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,583
How many terms do you have to calibrate...

41
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,458
Approximation of coordinates
in Marsden, '85.

42
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,958
Now that we have the comet's orbit,
we will check the ephemeris

43
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,458
and that will give us the distance
between the comet and planet Earth.

44
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,083
Why does the ephemeris
keep getting lower and lower?

45
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,833
Professor Mindy?

46
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,625
Professor Mindy?

47
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,041
You know what, guys? Let's...

48
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,458
Let's call it a night, huh?

49
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,916
But what about
the relative position?

50
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,500
I can't figure this one out.
Not tonight, guys. Sorry.

51
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,875
- Let's hit it, man. I'm beat.
- Me too.

52
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,375
- Kate, this was amazing.
- Congratulations.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,958
Hey, Kate.

54
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,666
You stay.

55
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,708
Yeah, Dr. Calder,

56
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,916
a Michigan State professor
and his grad students...

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,375
This is Dr. Calder.
You pulled me out of a meeting

58
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,291
where I had to tell my team
we lost eight billion in funding.

59
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,208
I am so sorry, Dr. Calder,

60
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,125
but we are seeing some
awfully strange orbital numbers

61
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,041
on this comet we just found.

62
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,958
They should be in your inbox, right?

63
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,916
- Is this it?
- Yeah. This is it.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,375
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let me get
Dr. Oglethorpe on the line.

65
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,791
Please hold.

66
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,250
I'm on hold.

67
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,500
She's calling a Dr. Oglethorpe.
Who is that?

68
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,083
Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna put them on speaker.

69
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,166
Dr. Oglethorpe,

70
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,666
head of the Planetary
Defense Coordination Office.

71
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,625
- Is that a real place?
- I have no idea.

72
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,625
This is Dr. Oglethorpe.

73
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,208
Yes, this is Jocelyn Calder

74
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,375
from Kennedy Space Center.

75
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,000
Hey, Jocelyn.

76
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,125
Listen, we got a sighting

77
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,500
of an NEO from Subaru telescope.

78
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,916
Okay...

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,458
Why you just didn't report it
to the Minor Planet Center?

80
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,333
It's a professor
and a bunch of Michigan State students

81
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,333
who identified something big.

82
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,833
Really? How large?

83
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,291
How big we talking?

84
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,666
We clocked it in around
five to ten kilometers wide.

85
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,250
About five to ten kilometers wide.

86
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,750
That's a big boy.

87
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:55,291
And was this professor the one
who first made the observations?

88
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,625
Hi, yes. Dr. Mindy.

89
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,083
And... And no,
PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky found it.

90
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,916
I did the orbital calculations.

91
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,250
I... I study trace gasses
in dead galaxies.

92
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,750
I haven't published in a while
so you probably haven't heard of me.

93
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,916
But anyway, that doesn't matter.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,333
Sorry. What was your question?

95
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,375
What are the most updated estimates
on its trajectory?

96
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,458
Kate?

97
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:27,041
I've been running it all day.
I keep getting the same result.

98
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,875
A direct hit of Earth
in six months and 14 days.

99
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,000
Me too.

100
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,333
Matthew,
what are your calculations?

101
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:40,500
Scout program
is saying six months, 14 days.

102
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,791
We got six months and 14 days.

103
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:48,916
And it's roughly five
to ten kilometers wide.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,125
Which... Which...

105
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,625
Isn't that...

106
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,083
an extinction-level event?

107
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,333
Well, let's not be dramatic here.

108
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,541
Okay...

109
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,291
First move is to get
the school field trip out here to DC.

110
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,833
Let's all calm down.

111
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,166
I need the person who first had eyes
on the comet

112
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,750
and the person in charge.

113
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,833
What?

114
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:21,208
Share this data immediately
with Cambridge, Caltech and IAU.

115
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,291
Wait a minute.
This is classified information.

116
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,708
What's happening?

117
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,833
I serve
at the discretion of the president.

118
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,166
Is this really happening?

119
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,666
And the dead galaxy professor
to Hickam Air Force base.

120
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,291
DC, right?
Hey! Hey, Kate.

121
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,291
This isn't happening, right?

122
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,541
Kate, this isn't real, right?
This is...

123
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,125
This is just some sort
of alternate reality, right?

124
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,041
Say something.

125
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,750
I gotta go get high.

126
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:48,041
Word is that I need you both in DC fast.
Only plane I got going there is that one.

127
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,375
Anyway, I am Dr. Mindy. This is...

128
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,208
- Hi!
- Go, go, go!

129
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,708
- Where do we sit, Kate?
- I have no idea.

130
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,625
Is there
any customary seating for...

131
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,625
What the fuck? Is this real?
Is this a goddamn joke?

132
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,833
Holy shit.

133
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,000
This can't be happening. No.

134
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,125
- Brendon. You mean Brendon?
- Yeah, Brendon.

135
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,041
You know, he didn't keep his head down.
It's all politics, Teddy. You know that.

136
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,083
You must be Randall and Kate.

137
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,250
Yes. Yes, hi.

138
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,583
I'm Dr. Oglethorpe,
but you can call me Teddy.

139
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,166
I'm sorry. Did you say your name...

140
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,333
- I should call you Teddy? Teddy.
- Teddy. Yeah.

141
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,083
Yeah, we call him Teddy
because he ain't no teddy bear.

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,416
General Themes.
I'm the Pentagon's eyes on...

143
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,375
you know,
whatever this turns out to be.

144
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,875
The president is famously late,
and you've had a long flight, so...

145
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,250
Michigan State Spartans.

146
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,583
- Is that the Oval Office?
- Yeah, that's the Oval Office, yeah.

147
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,541
It's a lot smaller
than in the photographs.

148
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,625
The president
should be here shortly.

149
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,875
She's already been briefed.

150
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,458
Correct, Scott?

151
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,166
That is correct.

152
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,750
Are we really about to tell
the president of the United States

153
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,583
that we have just over six months

154
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:12,166
until humankind, basically every species,
is completely extinct?

155
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,291
Yeah. That's exactly
what we're about to do. Yeah.

156
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,916
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

157
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,416
Yes, I said law enforcement.

158
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,708
But I didn't want... I mean,
you told me that he was clean.

159
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,166
- Hello, Madam President. Dr. Oglethorpe.
- Step back, please.

160
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,666
Hello.

161
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,208
Madam President, I'm Dr. Oglethorpe.
I believe Jocelyn briefed you to...

162
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,833
- Hey, Jason.
- Yeah? What up, yo?

163
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,166
Come on, man. What the hell?
This is real world.

164
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,875
Yeah. I know. We need five minutes.

165
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,625
We have a problem with our Supreme Court
nominee. Five minutes. Thank you.

166
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,541
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

167
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,958
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

168
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,541
<i>Happy birthday, dear Patty...</i>

169
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,750
Just take a message,
and then, stuff like this happens,

170
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,500
and I don't know what's going on.

171
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,541
I don't understand
how many more times I need to tell you...

172
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,500
Well, there's a bunch of stuff about
their nominee not being qualified,

173
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,875
but I don't see
any articles about our thing.

174
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,291
Social media is just going on and on

175
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,250
about that singer Riley Bina
and DJ Chello breaking up.

176
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,166
That's just too bad.

177
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,291
They seem like sweet kids.

178
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,541
I don't... I don't know them.

179
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,583
Which is...

180
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,375
- It's a shame though.
- Yeah.

181
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,625
- Do you know them, Kate?
- Yes.

182
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,416
But I don't really give a shit right now.

183
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,208
They charge
an arm and a leg for this stuff.

184
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,041
Ten apiece ought to do it.

185
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,625
- Grab a water.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,916
I've got Kate as well.

187
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,250
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

188
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,000
Here's a 20.

189
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,333
- You got change?
- No.

190
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,208
- I mean, I could ask the Marine.
- Yeah...

191
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,625
It's a Xanax.

192
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,750
I only take a quarter.
Otherwise I get...

193
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,958
- Kate.
- Thank you.

194
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,083
You know, you should be
careful with that much.

195
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,708
<i>This eagle's place is in the sky</i>

196
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,958
I'm very sorry. I have to be
in Okinawa by two o'clock tomorrow.

197
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,375
- What?
- What? Are you serious?

198
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,166
- This is very important.
- I have to go quell the natives.

199
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,875
Tell your daughter I said hello.

200
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:58,333
Isn't it important that he was
in the room with us? I mean, what...

201
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,833
Where do I pay for these?

202
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:07,958
It's free.

203
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,791
Really?

204
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,375
Yes, it's the White House.

205
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,916
The snacks are free.

206
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,583
What?

207
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,291
The general.

208
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,166
He charged us
for the snacks, but they're free.

209
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,416
Oh, gosh.

210
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,541
Why on earth would he do that?

211
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,291
Hey, peeps, it's not looking
like it's gonna happen tonight,

212
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,291
and I feel horrible.

213
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,291
We're gonna put you up
in a hotel somewhere.

214
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,541
Excuse me, does the president
know why we're here?

215
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,916
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

216
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,166
They must not know
why we're here, right?

217
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,875
They know, but you heard 'em.

218
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,291
- Do they even realize...
- Be ready for tomorrow.

219
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,708
How long it took for us to get...

220
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,708
And then they made us wait
for over seven hours,

221
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,916
but they never called us in.
I couldn't believe it.

222
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Of course they didn't call you in.
Kate, have you watched any news today?

223
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,958
No, I've been pretty wrapped up
in our... project.

224
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,500
Turn on your TV right now.

225
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,250
President Orlean is in
the middle of an all-time shit storm.

226
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,166
Sheriff Wade Conlon
was already a controversial nominee,

227
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,958
with no law degree and a record
of shoot first and ask questions later.

228
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,125
You watching?

229
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,250
With his background as a nude life model...

230
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,750
Yeah, I'm watching it right now.

231
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,250
The White House is in full crisis mode.

232
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,500
And, get this.

233
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,750
I found five former students

234
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:37,666
who are willing to go on record
that Conlon got noticeably aroused

235
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,375
when he posed for their drawing class.

236
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,916
I have no shame in what I did.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,916
Now, should I say noticeably aroused?

238
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,916
Or engorged? Because
I don't want this to read like clickbait.

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,708
You know, this is a real article.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,291
I just... Kate, can I get
something from you, please?

241
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,250
Sorry.

242
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,083
- Out of sorts tonight.
- Can we have this conversation?

243
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,083
I feel like we're skirting around this.

244
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you have an issue with my mom?
Is that what this is all about?

245
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,791
You can't tell me what's going on?

246
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,458
It's just the protocol.
Please, don't worry.

247
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:15,208
Oh, Marshall got a 172
on his LSATs and we're celebrating.

248
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,666
Way to go, Marshall.
I'm proud of you, buddy.

249
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,083
Thank you, Dad. Miss you.

250
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,708
Hey, how's Evan feeling?
Are the new meds working out?

251
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,666
I'm a solid four.

252
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,083
He's a solid four.

253
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,750
Well, that's better
than last month, right?

254
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,083
You know, just remember to speak up
in the meeting tomorrow. Okay?

255
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,750
- Yeah. I will.
- You get so quiet.

256
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,416
When it's time to take credit,
you kind of...

257
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,000
She asked you if you were a lesbian.
She did not say that you were a lesbian.

258
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,916
- It was a question.
- Hey, look, I'm...

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,208
Can I sit down with your mom
to have lunch in, like, seven months?

260
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:52,583
Seven... That's weirdly
specific and distant.

261
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,625
What is... This is my mom.

262
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,541
So...

263
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,041
I heard there's an asteroid
or a comet or something

264
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,958
that you don't like the looks of.

265
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,416
Tell me about it and then
tell me why you're telling me about it.

266
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,208
You got 20 minutes.

267
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,208
- Twenty minutes?
- That's you, Doc.

268
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,375
Go. Now. Go.

269
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,125
Madam President.

270
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,125
Approximately 36 hours ago,

271
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,791
PhD candidate
Kate Dibiasky here discovered

272
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,000
a very large comet.

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,791
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

274
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,541
A comet between
five to ten kilometers across,

275
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,875
that we estimate came from the...

276
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,250
from the... from the Oort cloud.

277
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,791
Which is the outermost part
of the solar system.

278
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,458
And...

279
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,416
And using Gauss's method
of orbital determination

280
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,625
and the average astrometric uncertainty
of 0.04 arcseconds, we then asked...

281
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:03,000
- What the hell is... What?
- I'm so bored. Just tell us what it is.

282
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,291
- What? Stop what?
- Seriously, stop.

283
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,416
What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is
there's a comet headed towards Earth,

284
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,708
and according to NASA's computers,

285
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,916
that object is gonna hit the Pacific Ocean

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,166
at 62 miles due west
off the coast of Chile.

287
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,166
Then what happens? Like, a tidal wave?

288
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,666
No. It will be far more catastrophic.

289
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,250
There'll be mile-high tsunamis
fanning out all across the globe.

290
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:32,333
If this comet makes impact, it will have
the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.

291
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,375
There'll be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes...

292
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,375
You're breathing weird.
It's making me uncomfortable.

293
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to articulate the science.

294
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,125
I know. But it's so stressful.
I'm trying to, like, listen...

295
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,916
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

296
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,875
I'm trying to articulate it
the best I can...

297
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,791
Madam President, this comet
is what we call a planet-killer.

298
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,333
That is correct.

299
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,333
So how certain is this?

300
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,541
There's 100% certainty of impact.

301
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,666
Please, don't say 100%.

302
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,333
Can we just call it
a potentially significant event?

303
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,458
- Yeah.
- Yes.

304
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,250
But it isn't potentially going to happen.

305
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,500
It is going to happen.

306
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,083
Exactly. 99.78% to be exact.

307
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,291
Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.

308
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,250
Well, scientists never like to say 100%.

309
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,791
Call it 70% and let's just move on.

310
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,541
But it's not even close to 70%.

311
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,958
You cannot go around saying to people

312
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,791
that there's 100% chance
that they're gonna die.

313
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,791
You know? It's just nuts.

314
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,458
We should get some of
our scientists on this, you know.

315
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,250
No offense, but you're just two people
that walked in here with...

316
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,541
Dr. Oglethorpe.

317
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
Dr. Ov... Ogilvy. Yeah.

318
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,791
I've been head of planetary defense
at NASA for 15 years.

319
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:55,333
And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at Michigan State,

320
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,375
where Miss Dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate.

321
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,083
- Good.
- I'm sorry. Did you say Michigan State?

322
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,750
Exactly. They have
an excellent astronomy department.

323
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,250
- Yes.
- Come on, bro.

324
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
You kidding?
You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?

325
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,708
Okay, let's bottom line this.

326
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,666
What is this gonna cost me?

327
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,875
You know, what's the ask here?

328
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,041
There are government plans in place.

329
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,541
Actions we can take through NASA.

330
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,583
Drones that can be outfitted with nukes

331
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:27,083
to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet.

332
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,916
We must act now.

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,583
Oh, hey.
All right, all right, all right.

334
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,000
- When are the midterms? Three weeks.
- Three weeks.

335
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,791
So, if this breaks before then,
we lose Congress.

336
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,833
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

337
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:39,833
It'll be gridlocked.

338
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,916
The timing is just... It's atrocious.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,125
Okay, at this very moment,
I say we sit tight and assess.

340
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,458
Sit tight and assess.

341
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,625
Let's get some other people
on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.

342
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,458
And you and I will review the NASA plans.

343
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,291
- Okay?
- I'd greatly appreciate that.

344
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,583
Am I to understand correctly that,

345
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,333
after all of the information
you've received today,

346
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:12,291
the decision you're making
is to sit tight and assess?

347
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,625
- I'm sorry, who is she?
- Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?

348
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,416
I'm the fucking Chief of Staff,
Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.

349
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,791
So I'm doing fine.

350
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,541
We gotta get out of here.
This place is a freak show.

351
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,208
I think what Miss Dibiasky
is trying to say

352
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:30,375
is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely, extremely dangerous...

353
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,750
Thank you.
One good thing happened today.

354
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,916
Okay, funny story.

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,666
When I was running for president,

356
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,958
I had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign

357
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,291
because, you know,
photographs of me smoking

358
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,333
went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?

359
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,541
So, I'm always hiding, but,
you know, I just got sick of it.

360
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,208
And I just said, you know what,
I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to.

361
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,791
Guess what happened?

362
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:06,500
- I went up three points in the polls.
- They loved that she kept it real.

363
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,458
They love watching a smokeshow smoke.

364
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,583
I can't think of another president
that I'd ever wanna see in Playboy.

365
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,000
Do you know how many
the world is ending meetings

366
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,708
that we've had over the years?

367
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,833
Economic collapse, loose nukes,
car exhaust killing the atmosphere.

368
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,666
- Rogue AI.
- Drought, famine, plague...

369
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,958
Everything.

370
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:28,833
Alien invasion,
population growth, hole in the ozone...

371
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:29,916
Jason, hey.

372
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,166
- Read the room for once in your life.
- Sorry, Mom.

373
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,000
Point is, I have a job to do.

374
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,833
You do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event.

375
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:43,250
This is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds...

376
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,333
Dr. Mindy, I hear you.

377
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,625
I hear you.

378
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,208
- You should be proud.
- Thank you.

379
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,666
I'm taking it very seriously.
I'm taking it straight in the heart.

380
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,875
I'm so glad to hear that.
You have no idea.

381
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked
about in here, super classified, right?

382
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,500
- Yeah.
- Cool.

383
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,750
Thanks for dressing up.

384
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,041
You're saying
we're just gonna leak it to the press?

385
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,625
- Isn't that illegal?
- Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.

386
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,333
In case you didn't notice,
the White House just blew us off.

387
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,375
My boyfriend, Phillip,
says he knows a reporter

388
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,458
from the New York Herald
who will talk to us.

389
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,250
- Adul Grelio.
- Good. He's a heavy hitter.

390
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,541
And I'll reach out to more of
the scientific community on the down-low.

391
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,416
- I just feel like this isn't what I do.
- You're just telling a story.

392
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,750
Keep it simple.

393
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,583
No math.

394
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,166
But it's all math.

395
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,333
It all started
with a connection.

396
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:03,041
A simple gesture that created so much.

397
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,000
So many choices.

398
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,541
Sometimes, it can even feel like too much.

399
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,875
Until now.

400
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,291
Introducing BASH LiiF.

401
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,791
Life, without the stress of living.

402
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,416
Before we introduce
the founder and CEO of BASH,

403
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,791
please remember
to avoid direct eye contact,

404
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,458
sudden movements,
coughing or negative facial expressions.

405
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:30,916
And now, please welcome
Sir Peter Isherwell.

406
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,791
We love you, Peter!

407
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,125
We love you, Peter!

408
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,375
Hello, everyone.

409
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,833
All of my life's work,

410
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:57,416
really, I see has been driven
by an inexpressible need for a friend

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,416
who would understand and soothe me.

412
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,791
And you know, now all those years of work
have come to fruition with BASH LiiF,

413
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:10,375
our new BASH 14.3 phone

414
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:14,750
is fully integrated
into your every feeling and desire

415
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:17,333
without you needing
to say one single word.

416
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,291
If I feel...

417
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,291
- Sad.
- Afraid.

418
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,458
Or alone.

419
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:25,750
The BASH 14.3 phone,
when set to the life setting,

420
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:28,958
instantly senses my mood
through blood pressure...

421
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,541
heartbeats and...

422
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,000
Your vitals
show that you are sad.

423
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,833
This will cheer you up, Peter.

424
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:40,583
<i>You are my best friend</i>

425
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,541
<i>You make me happy...</i>

426
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,416
Oh, that's wonderful.

427
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,666
That video...

428
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,083
It also, seriously, schedules

429
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,375
a therapy session
with a nearby professional,

430
00:26:55,458 --> 00:27:00,208
so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return.

431
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,958
- May I say something, Mr. Isherwell?
- No.

432
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:07,541
And to support BASH LiiF,
I wanna officially announce...

433
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,041
Oh, give me the phones.
They're not yours.

434
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,125
- Say bye.
- Bye, Mr. Isherwell.

435
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,458
Bye, Peter.

436
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,458
I love you, Peter.

437
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,333
Are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster

438
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:25,416
is optimizing our prepubescent
sense memory consumer sector?

439
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,166
I find the bird quite threatening.

440
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,291
We will cross-check
the data on that, for sure.

441
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,958
Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent
wanted me to give this to you.

442
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,791
He got it from
an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.

443
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, my.

444
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:43,000
What other confirmation
do we have on this, Adul?

445
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,416
I've spoken to Dr. Oglethorpe in DC
and he confirmed it and all the math.

446
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Then I showed it
to Dr. Franks at Columbia,

447
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,833
and he almost fell out of his chair.

448
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,875
So, look, I have to admit.
I was very skeptical at first,

449
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,583
but this is all quite credible.

450
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,916
The calculations are credible.

451
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,250
Jesus.

452
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,750
And the president
really said to sit tight?

453
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,583
- Yes. That's correct.
- Sit tight and assess.

454
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,708
She's probably worried about the midterms.

455
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,375
We need to move fast.

456
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,333
The feds will claim breach of security,

457
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:13,375
so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney.

458
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,458
- You can use my attorney.
- You can certainly afford it now.

459
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,833
We're gonna hire a lawyer?

460
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,166
- That wasn't necessary.
- It was.

461
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

462
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,166
That was not called for.

463
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,083
I just have a question here.

464
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,625
How is it criminal if we just tell people,

465
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:31,000
like the public, you know,
what we saw, and tell them the truth?

466
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,166
Make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows.

467
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,875
He seems a step slow.

468
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:38,083
What does that mean,
I need media training?

469
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,791
They want us on a show
called The Daily Rip

470
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,500
first thing in the morning
before the article comes out.

471
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,416
You guys know what The Daily Rip is?

472
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,000
It's like the best show.
Everyone wants to be on it.

473
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,916
Brie and Jack have legendary chemistry.

474
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,250
They asked me to go on once.

475
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,500
I was so excited
I couldn't sleep for two nights,

476
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,916
but then they cut me for time.

477
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,750
Still hurts me to think about that.

478
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:01,583
I know what show you're talking about.
My wife loves that show.

479
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:04,458
Okay, can you just tell me
what this is all about? Okay?

480
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:07,916
'Cause you haven't read my article
on Conlon getting hard in the art class.

481
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,791
Now Adul Grelio has come down
from his mountaintop for your thing.

482
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,625
You won't even give me
a lousy pronoun? Come on.

483
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,708
A comet, bigger than the asteroid
that destroyed the dinosaurs,

484
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,166
is headed directly at Earth.

485
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,541
If it isn't deflected,
the entire planet dies.

486
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,625
Wait, what did you just say?

487
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,000
It's for a video game.

488
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,791
Are you being serious?

489
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,541
Yes.

490
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,083
Oh, my God.

491
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,041
Oh, my God! What the fuck, man?

492
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,916
I love you too. All right. Yeah.

493
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,958
Hey, guys,
we gotta keep walking, all right?

494
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,208
Come on.

495
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,458
- You must be Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky?
- Yes.

496
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,833
Jack and Brie are so excited
to have you on the show.

497
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,750
Really? They know who we are?

498
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,166
White House is denying
they even met with them.

499
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,791
Well, assholes will always be assholes.

500
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,625
Hi, I'm Thalia.

501
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,000
The Herald sent me
to help with your wardrobe.

502
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,833
Oh, I'm not wearing that.

503
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:05,416
Yeah, you actually have
really great facial structure.

504
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,333
How 'bout if we trim
this beard down a little bit and...

505
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,833
I love your hair.

506
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,541
Thank you.

507
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,958
How are we gonna do this?
I talk about the discovery and you...

508
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,083
talk about how urgent it is
that we take action.

509
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,416
How do we say it? I mean...

510
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:26,125
- Shouldn't we practice it or write it out?
- Can I get you some water?

511
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,458
Yeah, water.
Yeah, water would be nice.

512
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,416
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

513
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,375
Eleven benevolent elephants.
Eleven benevolent elephants.

514
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,041
Just gonna take some Xanax.

515
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,833
I take it sometimes when I...

516
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,625
Kate, not this time. Not this time.

517
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:56,291
He just needs to breathe
and speak up. You know?

518
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,875
He's got this. I know he does.

519
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,458
Oh, God. Come on.

520
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,208
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

521
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,333
You're here now.

522
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,458
Oh, God!

523
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,375
You gotta
stop drinking the cheap shit.

524
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,750
- It's only two glasses.
- Yeah, two and a half.

525
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,541
- We're 20 out.
- Always running late.

526
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,541
Let's make sure that our eye lines,

527
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,250
that we're not looking
at Jack and Brie, please, all right?

528
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,708
And cue the package.

529
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,333
Two glasses. Here we go again.

530
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,708
- Ladies okay?
- Yes. And we're live.

531
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:58,083
Brie, I've got something for you today.
Listen to this.

532
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,041
President Orlean's Supreme Court nominee,
Sheriff Conlon,

533
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:06,208
has now been identified
as appearing in a softcore porn cable show

534
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,791
- from the early '90s...
- Ridiculous.

535
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,833
Called Satin Sheet Nights.

536
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,750
- This story just keeps going and going...
- Oh, my gosh.

537
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,125
Is that Riley Bina?

538
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,166
- Yes, well, it's a...
- Really?

539
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,208
She looks a lot smaller
in person, doesn't she?

540
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,750
Ride 'em, cowboy.

541
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,333
Good.

542
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:30,083
Hey, everyone. I'm Sean from the show.

543
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:33,875
We're gonna do... Jack and Brie
are gonna do ten on the SCOTUS nominee.

544
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,250
- Riley Bina, you'll come on and...
- I get to talk about my single, right?

545
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,291
A portion of the profits
goes to the manatee sanctuaries.

546
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,375
Yes, but the breakup first.

547
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:45,083
And then Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky,

548
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,583
you'll come on and talk about
that planet you discovered.

549
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,458
Comet. We found a comet.

550
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,666
They know what we're here
to talk about, right?

551
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,458
Of course. Jack and Brie
love doing science segments.

552
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,375
Just remember, keep it light, fun.

553
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:58,875
Jack and Brie love having a good time.

554
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,500
That's not promising.

555
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,708
You guys discovered a comet?
That's so dope.

556
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,916
I have a tattoo
of a shooting star on my back.

557
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,833
That's terrific.

558
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:17,750
We heard about your breakup too,
so we just wanna say...

559
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,333
We're very sorry, right?

560
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,291
We're real sorry.
You seem like a... great person.

561
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,583
Why don't you mind
your own business, you old fuck?

562
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Okay.

563
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,291
Not gonna lie, but my friends

564
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,750
and my Vroom Vroom Army
have been so amazing.

565
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:42,500
So, I'm really grateful for that.
But, yeah, I can't lie. It's been hard.

566
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,291
- You're an inspiration. It's incredible.
- To so many.

567
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,250
You're really owning that pain.

568
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:51,041
You know, Jack, I feel like
there's some kind of conversation

569
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,500
that we need to be having here.
Is there any message

570
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,750
that you would like
to send to your ex, DJ Chello?

571
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,083
You know...

572
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,625
If there's something...

573
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,291
- Yeah.
- Right here in this camera.

574
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:07,666
Tell him. As if that was him.
You tell him exactly what you're thinking.

575
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,208
Okay...

576
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,666
Chell.

577
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,250
I still love you,
and after many sleepless nights,

578
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,833
three,

579
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:23,875
I wanna take you back.

580
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,708
I'm sorry...

581
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,875
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,875
- He cheated on you.
- Oh, my God. You guys...

583
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,666
Yeah. I do.

584
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,000
- Diddly just exploded.
- So did Vroom Vroom.

585
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,250
BASH News just sent me
eight push notifications.

586
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,166
- About this?
- Yeah, look.

587
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,708
My phone just purchased
DJ Chello's latest single.

588
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,875
What the...
It just did that without asking.

589
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,791
I'm being told that
we have DJ Chello live on a Mugg link.

590
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,791
- What's he got to say for himself?
- I love the producers here.

591
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,125
Hey, baby doll. Hey.

592
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,083
- Hi. Hi, baby.
- He's in tears.

593
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,083
- Your kid messed up bad.
- I know.

594
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,666
Lady Baroque wasn't wearing
any panties in the club that night.

595
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,416
- It's fine.
- I just got all crazy.

596
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,416
I wasn't thinking straight.
I made a mistake.

597
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,375
But, look, it's always been you.

598
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,791
I get it. It's okay.

599
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,583
I hooked up with her too,
last year at the Music Globes

600
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,000
right before I ran off
with that power forward from the Nuggets,

601
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,250
and none of that matters.

602
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,916
What about forget breakup sex.
Try breakup relationship?

603
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,166
- That's good.
- Come on.

604
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,166
Ten famous second chances
for two-timers, guys.

605
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,166
It's on a plate.

606
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,125
I've been scared, but, honestly,
I'm not scared anymore.

607
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,041
Okay.

608
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,958
My little bumblebee, will you marry me?

609
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,625
Oh, my God. Of course.

610
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,208
- Chell, of course.
- Yes!

611
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,416
- Yes!
- That's sick.

612
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,333
Yes!

613
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,791
All right, DJ Chello.

614
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,875
What is happening?

615
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:41,916
Just bought another.

616
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,916
- Who are these people again?
- They're like the biggest names...

617
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,625
Well, the fireworks
have certainly gone off today.

618
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,875
- They have.
- What a zinger!

619
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,458
Yes, they have.

620
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:55,250
From a wedding proposal
to a little science experiment.

621
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,250
I'll need a temple rub
and a martini later on.

622
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:02,041
Our last guests today have made
a pretty big discovery in space.

623
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,041
Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy

624
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:07,208
and PhD candidate
Miss Kate Dibiasky are here.

625
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,333
Welcome to the show.

626
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,583
Can I ask you one thing before we go
any further? I have to know this.

627
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:14,208
Is there life out there?

628
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:17,708
- Can you tell us? Yes or no, final answer.
- We don't have the data.

629
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,958
But sure, in the vastness
of space, why not?

630
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,541
Yes, aliens are real.

631
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:24,166
I knew I'd like this guy.
Didn't I tell? You owe me 50 bucks.

632
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm not saying there's
little green men in flying saucers...

633
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,208
- Please don't encourage him, Dr. Mindy.
- That's what he's saying.

634
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,708
We'll never get out of here.

635
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,541
Now, Jack was having some fun here.

636
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,166
- Dad looks great.
- What did...

637
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,583
- Doesn't he look good?
- They did something with his beard.

638
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,583
With the aliens...

639
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,458
Really... He really does.

640
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,625
- So much.
- Dr. Randall...

641
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:47,125
You'll regret it. Now, look,
Jack's just having some fun here

642
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,875
with the aliens or whatever,

643
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:53,250
but there's a New York Herald story
that's just come out that talks about...

644
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,375
Keep it right there. You're doing good.

645
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:57,833
- The two of you have made.
- That's right, Brie.

646
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,958
Kate was observing supernovas...

647
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,583
Yo, that's your girl?

648
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:05,083
- Yeah.
- Not bad.

649
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:09,625
An absolutely shocking
and once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

650
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,000
I had no idea that Subaru made telescopes.

651
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,166
This has to be exciting.
Tell us what you found, Miss Diabasky.

652
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,250
I was monitoring exploding stars

653
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:26,750
to help measure
the expansion of the universe and...

654
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,875
- For your PhD, right?
- Yeah.

655
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:33,125
I saw something I didn't recognize.

656
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,041
It was a comet.

657
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,166
A big one.

658
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:44,583
It's headed directly at Earth,
and it really likely will hit.

659
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,791
This sounds very, very exciting.

660
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,458
Exploding stars, like,
stars actually explode.

661
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,708
How big is this thing?

662
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,083
Can it destroy someone's house?
Is that possible?

663
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,333
Well, Comet Dibiasky, which is
what it will officially be named...

664
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:58,833
- After her?
- Yeah, after her.

665
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,583
- Congratulations.
- What an honor. Congratulations.

666
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,166
It's somewhere between
six and nine kilometers across.

667
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,583
- So...
- It's big.

668
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,875
It would damage the entire planet.

669
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,583
Not just a house, you know?

670
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,708
The entire planet.

671
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,708
Okay, as it's damaging,
will it hit this one house in particular

672
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,875
that's right on the coast of New Jersey?
It's my ex-wife's house.

673
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,208
Can we make that happen?

674
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,708
You and Shelly have
a great relationship. Stop.

675
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,125
You need to stop.

676
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,125
I will, but in all fairness,
I actually paid for the house.

677
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,500
I'm so sorry.

678
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,583
I'm sorry, are we not being clear?

679
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,791
We're trying to tell you

680
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:37,291
that the entire planet
is about to be destroyed.

681
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,291
- Okay...
- Well, it's, you know...

682
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,625
It's something we do around here.
We just keep the bad news light.

683
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,625
Right.
It helps the medicine go down.

684
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,666
Speaking of medicine, tomorrow we've got...

685
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,541
Well, maybe the destruction
of the entire planet

686
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,833
isn't supposed to be fun.

687
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,250
Maybe it's supposed to be terrifying.

688
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,333
And unsettling.

689
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,125
No, please don't do that.

690
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,333
- And you should stay up all night...
- Please.

691
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,250
Every night crying,

692
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,750
when we're all 100%
for sure gonna fucking die!

693
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,416
Hey, Kate.

694
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
I'm sorry.

695
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:15,708
Hey, man.

696
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,708
My brother has bipolar disorder.
So if you ever need anyone to talk...

697
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,583
Okay.

698
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,583
Is she always like that?

699
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,083
- I...
- Something I said?

700
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,083
Right?

701
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,625
Maybe I should have given her
that extra Xanax that I had.

702
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:38,208
Listen, if you don't have enough,
we all have enough around here for her.

703
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:41,166
A spoonful of Xanax
makes the medicine go down, right?

704
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,916
That's right. That's good.

705
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:47,166
- We're gonna have to get you back.
- I knew I'd like this guy.

706
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,333
- Is he a plant?
- I knew it.

707
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,333
Okay.

708
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,791
Well, the handsome astronomer

709
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:56,375
can come back anytime,
but the yelling lady, not so much.

710
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,416
Not so much. Join us tomorrow
when our guest will be the man

711
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,083
that many say will challenge
President Orlean in two years.

712
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,166
Senator Jeff Lerner will be here.

713
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,000
And wrongly-convicted murderer,
Michelle Weems,

714
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:12,375
talks to us about her controversial
third-place finish on Celebrity Dance Off.

715
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,833
- I thought she would've won.
- Yes. I still think she's guilty.

716
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,083
- That's The Daily Rip, guys.
- Have a great day.

717
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,583
- And we're out!
- The show's over?

718
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:21,958
- I mean, didn't...
- Yeah.

719
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,500
- Did what we wanted to say come across?
- No, it's over.

720
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:28,500
You were great, but I think mullet girl,
she probably needs some media training.

721
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,291
- Really?
- Yeah, no, terrible, buddy.

722
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,916
Thanks. Thanks, Billy.

723
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,500
We usually get drinks at Aundrine's
after our five o'clock staff meeting.

724
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,041
You know, it's fun. You should come.

725
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,041
Oh, I'll have to see.
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.

726
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,291
Kate? Kate?

727
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,250
- Hey. You were awesome.
- Oh, thanks.

728
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,291
Can I get a photo of you for my portfolio?

729
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,666
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

730
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,083
Thank you.

731
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:59,166
You can see this spike here

732
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,375
is when Riley Bina
asked to take DJ Chello back

733
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,750
on the segment before you.

734
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:06,041
We saw engagement across
all social media platforms.

735
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,916
And what about our story?

736
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,958
Randall and Kate,

737
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,750
your TV appearance got some nice traffic
when Miss Dibiasky cursed.

738
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,041
But, unfortunately,
there was an immediate backlash

739
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,833
that quickly became a meme.

740
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,208
Oh, Jesus.

741
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:26,250
- Oh, that's terrible.
- They just think I'm crazy.

742
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,333
I mean, look at that.
That's so unnecessary.

743
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,125
- You can move on, Erin.
- Yeah.

744
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,916
That is just so...
Is that even allowed on the internet or...

745
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,625
I think that's Photoshop, Kate.

746
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:40,083
The trick is
to not take it personal...

747
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:44,458
Dr. Mindy, on the other hand,
had some very high favorables.

748
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:49,125
Vegan*Babe wrote...
Meow! Me likey hunky Star Man.

749
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,208
Some accounts called him
The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet

750
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:55,083
or A-I-L-F, which means
astronomer I'd like to fuck.

751
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,666
I don't see what that has
to do with anything, do you?

752
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,500
And that's everything.

753
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,666
We did not feature or push on any sites,

754
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,083
and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories.

755
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
So that... that... that's it?

756
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,333
- I knew it.
- That's it.

757
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,833
- Thank you, Erin.
- Yeah, no problem.

758
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,750
I don't... I don't understand.

759
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,666
I don't understand. There's no response.

760
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,375
There's absolutely no...
Why aren't people terrified?

761
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,458
What do we have to say?
What do we have to do?

762
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,916
There are scientists in Mexico and Spain
who are currently going through the data,

763
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,708
and South Korea has expressed...

764
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:36,500
- That's great. South Korea.
- Hey.

765
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:39,041
Let us not bullshit each other.

766
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:42,791
The bottom line is,
you guys told us the science was 100%.

767
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,625
It's not. Now we look like idiots.

768
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,291
- No. Who said the science is not 100%?
- Excuse me?

769
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,250
I wanna talk to this person.
You tell me who said the science...

770
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,333
Dr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA,

771
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:56,625
just came out calling it
more near-miss hysteria.

772
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,625
She's the one
who told us not to say anything.

773
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,083
More near-miss hysteria.

774
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,291
Is she even an astronomer?

775
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:04,458
She's the head of NASA, but maybe
she doesn't know what she's talking about.

776
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,958
She's the head of NASA, but look,

777
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,875
she's a former anesthesiologist
and a President Orlean super donor.

778
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:11,583
Let's not be dramatic here.

779
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,666
It's all corrupt.

780
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,416
Yes, but the point is that Adul's right.
There's still serious debate.

781
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,708
And now the Herald has egg on its face.

782
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,916
We've taken that story as far as it goes.

783
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,625
Ladies, gentlemen,
I wish you a very pleasant end of times.

784
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,708
It's not a goddamn story, okay?

785
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,916
We have precisely six months, ten days,

786
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,250
two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds,

787
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,000
until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub

788
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,833
tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on Earth.

789
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,833
When did you
do those calculations?

790
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,250
I put the moment of impact on a diet app.

791
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:51,958
So, impact is when my diet ends.

792
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:56,125
Only I'm not on a diet.
I'm just crying five times a day.

793
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,125
- I'm scared.
- Hey, come on. Come on.

794
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,416
Everyone should be
panicking right now, okay?

795
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,416
- Don't cry. Come on.
- I know.

796
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,291
That prick!

797
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,666
What happened?

798
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,083
Guess my boyfriend just broke up with me.

799
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:24,500
God, what a day. What a day...

800
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:35,958
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die! You're...

801
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,708
It started with
a photo many thought was an armpit

802
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,458
or the chin of a man with a strange beard.

803
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,833
But what's emerging now is a scandal...

804
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,833
President Orlean sent
her Supreme Court nominee

805
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:00,583
a cell phone picture of her private parts.

806
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,708
- Holy crap!
- It's clickbait material.

807
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,250
Is this what you want
in your country as a leader?

808
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,708
Isn't she the same person
who told poor people

809
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:11,833
that if they don't wanna be poor,
they should pick better lottery numbers?

810
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:12,958
She actually said that.

811
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,541
A source also confirmed to me that

812
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,750
the two have been
having an affair for years.

813
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,416
And as recently as yesterday...

814
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,583
Members of my party
are currently drawing up a formal censure

815
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:23,625
of the president,

816
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,500
Janie Orlean...

817
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,916
Oh, my God, honey.

818
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,791
This guy doesn't even know
what a heliocentric orbit is,

819
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,625
and he's calling me a crackpot.

820
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,708
He says that,

821
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,166
Jewish billionaires
invented this comet threat

822
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,125
so the government
can confiscate our liberty and our guns.

823
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,500
#DontBeScared. Unbelievable.

824
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,041
My God.

825
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,041
You've been on that site a lot lately.

826
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:54,833
Yeah. I mean, I... I have, like,
a quarter million subscribers, honey.

827
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,875
I gotta use my voice
to get the truth out there, right?

828
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,916
I'm going for a walk
if you wanna come.

829
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,750
It is called
the scientific method...

830
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,666
and it is what created the computer

831
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,666
that you are typing
your half-witted conspiracy theories on.

832
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,708
What do you think about that?

833
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,958
Randall?

834
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,250
- Yeah, honey?
- Someone's here to see you.

835
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,083
Who? Oh, boy.

836
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,500
Oh, my gosh.

837
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:35,458
Oh, God, right. Okay.

838
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,375
Right.

839
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,166
Are you Dr. Randall Mindy?

840
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,416
Yes, sir. I am.

841
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,833
We're all gonna die.

842
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,708
Fuck off, please.

843
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,958
FBI! Freeze! Get on your knees right now!
Get on your knees!

844
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,500
You're under arrest
for breach of national security secrets.

845
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,458
Jesus Christ!

846
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:00,125
You could've just called me
or showed up to my apartment.

847
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,208
What are you, dressed up as a blind guy?

848
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,583
- Get on the ground!
- Okay. Now be cool.

849
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,083
I just have
more skin pigmentation than you.

850
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,083
'Cause your ancestors
migrated to Northern Europe

851
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,250
and developed lighter skin
so as to not get...

852
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,958
Unless you assholes
are taking me to the Batcave,

853
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:24,791
fuck you for putting this hood on me.

854
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,541
Watch out for him.
He'll charge you for free shit.

855
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,583
What's he doing here?
Is he here for us?

856
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,625
Gentlemen, you can come in.

857
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,541
I think
it was Winston Churchill who...

858
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:47,500
Or maybe it was Bobby Knight
who said, the great labor of leadership

859
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:51,083
is to lay down one's yoke of pride

860
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,791
and admit that mistakes were made.

861
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:58,041
You were deceived,
as was I, but the end result was,

862
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,791
we had our scientists who went to
the prestigious schools of Harvard,

863
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,000
Princeton, et cetera.

864
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,416
They confirmed the data.
So we would like to offer you a...

865
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,000
presidential apology.

866
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,000
Really?

867
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,625
And we are fully prepared to mobilize

868
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,583
in historic fashion
in order to save this planet.

869
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,875
The best news
we've heard in a long time.

870
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,541
So, basically, what you're saying is

871
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:31,458
you're about to lose the midterms
'cause you got caught

872
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:35,625
sending pictures of your cooch
to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.

873
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:39,625
So now it's to your advantage
to act on the comet?

874
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:42,708
Right.

875
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:44,041
Okay.

876
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:46,000
Okay. I'm just...

877
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,041
God, I'm so relieved
that you guys are doing something.

878
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:54,708
- Hey, come on. Hey.
- This has been really...

879
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,958
- Really, really hard.
- Come here.

880
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,166
This has been really, really,
really stressful on all of us.

881
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,291
Yes, I will agree.

882
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,583
This will take some
heavy weight off all of us...

883
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,583
Sorry, you just look
so bad when you cry.

884
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,458
Maybe, possibly.

885
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,458
People are gonna ask
why we didn't act earlier.

886
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,958
So you're gonna have
to take the hit on this one.

887
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:16,083
Yeah, but we'll take care
of you down the road, Jocelyn.

888
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,375
- We will.
- Of course, Janie.

889
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,500
I will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow.

890
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,291
- Good. Yeah, good.
- That's weird as hell.

891
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,458
She's an anesthesiologist.

892
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:29,541
I'm going to make a statement,

893
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:32,166
presidential statement
to the American people.

894
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,041
And we're not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time

895
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,916
because that way
it will have the appearance

896
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,666
of a breaking emergency sort of...

897
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,166
Good things
come to those who wait.

898
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,166
See?

899
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,125
Oh, my God!

900
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:53,166
We interrupt this broadcast
of Jackpot Fiancé

901
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,500
for an emergency message
from the president of the United States.

902
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,875
Citizens of the United States
and peoples of the world,

903
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,791
I have just been handed

904
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:09,000
scientific findings that
confirm a worst-case scenario.

905
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:14,833
An unprecedented comet,
nine kilometers wide,

906
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:21,333
is now on a direct collision course
with our cherished home, planet Earth.

907
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:24,666
Estimated time of arrival
is approximately five months from now.

908
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,666
So we have...

909
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,958
We've drawn up a massive
Congressional spending bill...

910
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,791
I have already put together an emergency
spending package for Congress...

911
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:34,083
That the Senate
and the House have agreed upon.

912
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,000
That's good to hear.

913
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:39,166
And that will enable NASA
and our great military

914
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,083
to launch a preemptive strike,

915
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:46,250
using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites

916
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:49,041
loaded with nuclear explosives.

917
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:53,333
We will blow Comet Dibiasky
off her course...

918
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,458
But we're gonna need a hero.

919
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:58,791
We're gonna need a pilot, real guns and...

920
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:02,250
Shouldn't this mission be accomplished
using remote technology?

921
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,541
Washington's always gotta have a hero.

922
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,000
I have asked

923
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Medal of Freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot, Benedict Drask,

924
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:16,250
to undertake this difficult and...

925
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,958
I'm sorry.
Isn't he the mercenary gentleman

926
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,416
that was screaming at all those children
on the White House lawn?

927
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,916
Yeah.
He was given the honor of leading

928
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,333
the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise.

929
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,250
Get a little air into it, you lard-ass...

930
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,333
You look like a goddamn bunch of pussies.

931
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,666
- I'm sorry.
- He's just of another generation.

932
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,083
You know, I used to date him.

933
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:41,375
Know what happened to the last pussy
I worked with in combat?

934
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,250
You ever see inside a man's torso?

935
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,541
Benedict Drask reporting for duty.

936
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:53,791
- Thank you for the...
- He's gonna be fantastic.

937
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,458
He's got a great voice.

938
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,166
- We're gonna let him make a statement.
- Some are saying this is a...

939
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,625
He's got a great body too.

940
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,250
- He does.
- Yeah.

941
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,958
Suicide mission.

942
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,458
Well, all I ask is,

943
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:06,875
if I get snuffed,

944
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:11,458
that you all earn
the extra living my sacrifice gives you.

945
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:14,000
The extra living
my sacrifice gives them.

946
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,500
- Right?
- I wrote that.

947
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,708
Isn't that from Saving Private Ryan?

948
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:21,708
- Yes.
- No, that's something totally different.

949
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:25,500
And special thanks should also go
to this team of scientists behind me...

950
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,250
We're gonna need
everybody's help on this.

951
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,208
Everybody.

952
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,916
All have to pitch in
and push out this message.

953
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,458
African-American scientist.

954
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,125
Miss Dibiasky, she...

955
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:40,583
And we have Kate Dibiasky,
who the comet is named after,

956
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,458
but don't blame her.

957
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:46,166
Connects with the disaffected youth
and the mentally ill.

958
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,125
- And other marginal groups.
- Thank you.

959
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:51,500
- We'll do whatever we can.
- As long as you do the right thing.

960
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,916
We're there for you.

961
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,250
Especially you, Dr. Mindy,
because you poll so much higher

962
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,666
than your colleagues.
It's wild.

963
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:04,250
He will help us destroy
our common enemy, Dibiasky.

964
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,041
Wonderful. Well, I think we're done.

965
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,666
Yep, okay. Let's go.

966
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,291
Can I say something?

967
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,583
We've been dying to hear
what you gotta say.

968
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,375
I didn't vote for you.

969
00:54:16,541 --> 00:54:22,708
But this is obviously
much bigger than my misgivings.

970
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:27,125
So I will be 100% behind this effort.

971
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,791
No matter how offensive I may find you.

972
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:34,375
That's great.

973
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,291
Yeah. That's really nice.

974
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,208
You know, I did have the FBI
put that bag over your head.

975
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:42,291
They don't do that.
The CIA does, but I made them do it.

976
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,083
You know, I had a feeling. I really did.

977
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,416
It's a good feeling
'cause that is what I did.

978
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,291
- And it was very funny and cool.
- Okay.

979
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:55,458
May Jesus Christ
bless every single one of you,

980
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:59,333
especially the honorable members
of my own party.

981
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,125
We will prevail.

982
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,208
We're all gonna die!

983
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,083
Guys, this comet
is seriously stressing me out.

984
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:40,250
Well, it's coming. People gotta dig in.

985
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,708
I already got buyers
for these shovels on e-market.

986
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:46,833
Clean sweep for President Orlean
in these midterm elections.

987
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,250
- How hot he is.
- Thousand bucks a pop.

988
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,916
Discharge the duties
on which I am about to enter.

989
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,083
So help you God.

990
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:00,416
- So help me God.
- Congratulations.

991
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:05,458
We have talk of
a Nobel Peace Prize in the offing.

992
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:08,833
He's not hot.

993
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,041
Hello, Sammy.

994
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,416
Are you really a doctor?

995
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,750
Well, sort of. I'm an astronomer.

996
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:35,833
What is an astronomer?

997
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:38,708
Dr. Mindy, there is
a lot of fear out there,

998
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:40,541
in America, around the world.

999
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:42,708
Parents don't know
what to say to their kids.

1000
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:45,291
What would you say to them
to help them understand?

1001
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:48,791
Well, I'm sure many of us
are frightened right now.

1002
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:55,708
But I can assure you, our best
and our brightest, they're on the job.

1003
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,458
I've seen the science
on this plan and it is sound.

1004
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:05,208
I know your words are a great comfort
to all our viewers, Dr. Randall,

1005
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:09,416
and we thank you
for your courage and your service.

1006
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,166
I'd just like to say

1007
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:16,541
that whenever
I feel afraid or alone in this, I...

1008
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:21,000
I think of you and I just...
I feel better.

1009
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,375
So thank you.

1010
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,375
That's my job.

1011
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,583
- Tell me we're all gonna die.
- What?

1012
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,500
- Tell me we're all gonna die, do it.
- We're all gonna die.

1013
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:43,708
Oh, boy.

1014
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:47,375
So, these two Marxists
wave around the word science

1015
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,583
and we're all supposed
to do whatever they say?

1016
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,291
Yeah, how do we know
there even is a comet?

1017
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:56,125
Mr. Pawketty, Congressman,
this data has been proven

1018
00:57:56,208 --> 00:58:00,458
and has been peer-reviewed
by hundreds of world-renowned scientists.

1019
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:04,541
And we're supposed to trust you?
The comet's got your name.

1020
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,916
I don't... I don't see the relevancy.

1021
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,791
Why won't you
answer the question?

1022
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,916
- Answer the question.
- What's the question?

1023
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,125
Grow up here, okay?

1024
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,416
This is ridiculous.

1025
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:20,416
I've just realized, we don't really know
anything about each other. Do we?

1026
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,083
True.

1027
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:27,666
Well, every time I try
to ask you about your life,

1028
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,416
you seem to just tell me
about your favorite restaurants.

1029
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,541
Well, I... You know...

1030
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,041
I just despise the, you know,

1031
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,291
getting-to-know-you part
of relationships, so...

1032
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, okay. I understand.

1033
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,208
Okay, let's just
get it over and done with.

1034
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:48,916
Okay...

1035
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,708
Right, so...

1036
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:56,833
My grandfather invented
the flash-freezing process.

1037
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:59,166
So I come from grotesque money,

1038
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:03,500
but I got away from it
by getting three masters degrees.

1039
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,125
I've been divorced twice.

1040
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:13,708
One was a Secretary of State,
and the other one was a sport fisherman.

1041
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:19,666
I have slept
with two former presidents.

1042
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:24,583
I speak four languages,
and I own two Monets.

1043
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,958
Two former presidents.

1044
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,875
- What, my turn?
- Yeah.

1045
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:40,250
All right. My father was
a middle school geography teacher.

1046
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:43,583
My mother,
she cut hair out of the kitchen.

1047
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:47,500
About two years ago,
our family dog, JoJo, died,

1048
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,583
which was really, really emotional.

1049
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:53,041
I can't remember crying that much ever.

1050
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:55,541
And...

1051
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:02,541
I finally got my Star Wars poster
signed by Mark Hamill.

1052
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,708
It's in the garage. It's... So, yeah.

1053
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,666
Okay, good.

1054
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:10,958
That's done.

1055
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,958
Where are we gonna go for dinner tonight?

1056
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,916
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.

1057
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,750
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.

1058
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:36,083
He leads me beside the quiet waters.
He restores my soul.

1059
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,583
Not since D-Day have we seen
such a mass mobilization

1060
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:43,416
of unions and resources
for such a noble task.

1061
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,916
One cannot help but be moved
by the bravery, ingenuity,

1062
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,083
and sacrifice on display here.

1063
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,125
Okay, here we go, everyone.
Let's stay sharp.

1064
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:17,416
I just want you to know,
this is the most propulsive thing

1065
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,041
that's ever happened to me. Thank you.

1066
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:36,541
What's the holdup, you guys?
What are you waiting on?

1067
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,625
Come on, motherfuckers,
let's light this fucking firecracker, huh?

1068
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,541
Think I got all day?

1069
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:47,208
Commander Drask,
this is your president speaking.

1070
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,333
Your nation thanks you.

1071
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,708
Your planet thanks you.

1072
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:55,875
And God and I thank you.

1073
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:59,208
Listen, the only thanks I need
is a shot of Jack Daniels.

1074
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:03,208
And a couple DUIs to magically go away.

1075
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,916
This is Mission Control.
All indicators are coming up green.

1076
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,416
This is a final warning
to control the launchpad.

1077
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:17,208
Your discovery led to this mission
and our chance to save Earth.

1078
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,666
I give you...

1079
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,041
the honor.

1080
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,458
Thank you.

1081
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:34,958
Thank you,
Madam President.

1082
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,833
Citizens of planet Earth,

1083
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:43,041
everything is theoretically impossible

1084
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:45,125
until it is done.

1085
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,541
And with that,

1086
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:49,750
we are go for launch.

1087
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:50,708
Yes.

1088
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,458
- That's fire.
- Thank you.

1089
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,541
It was lit.

1090
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,083
Hey, everyone, mind if I join?

1091
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,000
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter. Hi.

1092
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:04,708
Hi. Oh, Brie, you look fabulous.

1093
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:05,791
As always.

1094
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,333
Is he allowed to be in here?

1095
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:12,291
Yeah, he's a Platinum Eagle level donor
to the campaign. He has full clearance.

1096
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,000
Launch mission array.

1097
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:17,625
Molly kicking in right now.
Timed that shit perfect.

1098
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:20,666
Ten, nine, eight...

1099
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:24,791
seven, six, five, four...

1100
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,125
Three...

1101
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:41,750
Thank God!

1102
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:03,541
<i>Oh, Susannah,
don't you cry for me</i>

1103
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:07,958
<i>I come from Alabama
with a banjo on my knee, hey!</i>

1104
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,583
We didn't lose
any satellites.

1105
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:14,916
Margin of error
was for two to malfunction.

1106
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,166
Hey, Madam President, may I have a word
with you outside for a moment, please?

1107
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:20,916
Oh, my God.

1108
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,791
Mission success probability
is already increased to 81%.

1109
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,875
Outstanding.

1110
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:27,750
Janie, now!

1111
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,583
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1112
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,250
Peter, I didn't mean...

1113
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,708
And a big hello to that beautiful
blue ball down there we all call home.

1114
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:45,625
All those proud white folks working hard.

1115
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,083
God bless you.

1116
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,125
Just a different generation. Yeah.

1117
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:53,666
I also wanna say hello
to all the Indians out there.

1118
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:54,833
Both kinds.

1119
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:59,041
You know, the ones with the elephants
and the ones with the bow and arrows.

1120
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,500
Hey, why haven't you guys ever teamed up?

1121
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,458
How cool would that be, huh?

1122
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,458
I wanna say hello
to all the gays out there.

1123
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,875
Commander, booster ejection is imminent.

1124
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:10,208
- Let's keep comm on mission.
- Roger that.

1125
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,666
Separation confirmed.

1126
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,500
Separation confirmed.

1127
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,166
Was that French?

1128
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:37,000
Yes, it is. It means, the angels soar
to the heavens. It's...

1129
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:42,458
It's from a 14th-century poem
I studied in Dartmouth.

1130
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:45,875
And just watching this,
it just made me think of it,

1131
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,416
and think of you.

1132
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,500
God, I can't...

1133
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:52,333
can't...

1134
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,125
Go! Go! Go!

1135
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:08,666
I think I probably should go
to the hospital and see what they...

1136
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,708
Launch challenge!

1137
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:13,666
Go! Go! Go!

1138
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:19,583
Everyone, I have just received

1139
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:23,416
some critical information
concerning our mission.

1140
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,291
Looks like it's turning around.

1141
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:40,250
No, it's not. It's a course correction.

1142
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,875
It's pretty standard.

1143
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,416
I was in the Navy.

1144
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,375
Nope. It's turning around.

1145
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:51,166
Seems to be
some confusion here amongst the crowd,

1146
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,875
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

1147
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,916
This reporter
is at a loss for words right now.

1148
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,208
It's definitely turning around.

1149
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:01,416
I'm looking straight at it.

1150
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Drask's ship is definitely turning around.

1151
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:10,291
Does anyone know
what the fuck just happened?

1152
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:17,583
It's still locked.

1153
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,375
I just don't... I don't understand
what could've happened.

1154
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,250
I mean, the mission was working, right?
Everything was on track.

1155
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:26,166
Yeah. I mean,
it could've been anything...

1156
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:31,958
Guidance system could've malfunctioned,
nuke destabilized, myriad of things.

1157
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:35,625
Who was that guy that walked into
the Situation Room? He looked familiar.

1158
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:42,083
That was Peter Isherwell, CEO of BASH,
and the third richest human ever.

1159
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:46,125
He's the guy that bought
the Gutenberg Bible and lost it.

1160
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:48,916
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1161
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,833
Things are extremely fluid.

1162
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:56,916
Dr. Randall, you are now the Chief
Science Advisor to the White House.

1163
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,833
What?

1164
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:00,666
As such, you need to attend
an emergency Cabinet meeting

1165
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,000
where you will be debriefed.

1166
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,083
What about us?

1167
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,166
You do not have clearance
for this, sweetheart. Don't trip.

1168
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,000
Got you some crackers, some waters.

1169
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:10,750
You don't need to throw it on the floor.

1170
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,375
Gonna be three, four hours, tops.

1171
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,583
Here, Kate. I don't know
why he threw 'em down. Here.

1172
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:17,750
What if we have to go to the bathroom?

1173
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:21,250
We'll lay out some newspaper for you.
Grab you a can of Febreze.

1174
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,208
Short, sweet
and simple science.

1175
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:24,958
I'll be back. All right. Come on.

1176
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:27,083
Science tells the truth, Randall.

1177
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,500
Fuck. Do you wanna come?

1178
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:31,500
Yeah.

1179
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:35,625
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we thought,

1180
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:40,708
what the world thought
was an impending and terrifying danger,

1181
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:44,625
turns out to be
an astonishing opportunity.

1182
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,166
Our allies are very confused
and demanding answers...

1183
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,541
Well, tell 'em to wait.

1184
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:54,666
According to the most recent
spectrometer readings of Comet Dibiasky,

1185
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,833
made by the astrogeologists
at BASH Cellular,

1186
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,291
we've discovered something.

1187
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,000
Something truly miraculous.

1188
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,125
Peter. Peter?

1189
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,000
Oh, thank you, Janie.

1190
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,708
As... As some of you may know,

1191
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:17,541
the most valuable minerals in the world

1192
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,750
are fast becoming those that are deployed

1193
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:24,000
in the manufacture
of cell phones and computers.

1194
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:27,583
Yttrium, terbium, osmium, dysprosium,
on and on and on.

1195
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,000
We're running short.

1196
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,916
And the problem
is exacerbated, of course,

1197
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,916
because China has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines

1198
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,500
that produce
these valuable rare Earth assets.

1199
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,625
So you can imagine.

1200
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,541
Just how happy we were at BASH

1201
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,250
when our astrogeologists discovered

1202
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:57,000
and then determined that this comet,
hurtling towards us from deep space,

1203
01:09:57,083 --> 01:10:02,833
actually contains at least $32 trillion
of these critical materials.

1204
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:04,666
Critical to technology.

1205
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,958
If we're to proceed...

1206
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:08,541
I'm sorry. Is that why
you aborted this entire mission,

1207
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,541
is because you're trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals?

1208
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,708
I think
we should hold all questions

1209
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,458
until the end of the presentation,

1210
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,125
and you might find
that your questions are answered.

1211
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:21,750
Yes, Madam President.

1212
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,875
When you...
When the other metals are factored in,

1213
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,333
the comet actually contains

1214
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:31,541
almost $140 trillion worth of assets.

1215
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:32,916
Buck-forty trilli.

1216
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,291
Yeah...

1217
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:40,000
What do these trillions of dollars
even matter if we're all gonna die...

1218
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,458
I was about to ask
the same question, Janie.

1219
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,666
Why weren't we consulted?

1220
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,250
All due respect, Madam President...

1221
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,833
Oh, no!
What if we're rich and we're safe?

1222
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,125
I've gone over it
again and again and again in my head

1223
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,791
and I still can't make sense of it.

1224
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:03,791
He's a three-star general.
He works at the Pentagon.

1225
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:09,000
Why would he charge us for free snacks?

1226
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,750
One time, I met Sting,

1227
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:18,291
and I swear to God,
he farted right in front of me.

1228
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:24,458
Didn't break eye contact
and didn't even say excuse me.

1229
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,083
And the thing is,
he actually pulled it off.

1230
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,875
'Cause I still found him
to be quite charming.

1231
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:40,333
Guys, we have to talk.
Come on, let's go. Come on, now.

1232
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:44,625
It's insane. Like, completely insane.

1233
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,041
It will never work.

1234
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,291
I had the exact same reaction.

1235
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,500
This is a nine-kilometer-wide
planet-killer we're talking about,

1236
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,041
not roaming charges.

1237
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:59,041
Look, I... I was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too,

1238
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:01,708
but they've got
Gary Talcamont from Stanford

1239
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,958
and Lisa Inez from Princeton
on their team.

1240
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:07,750
I mean, this is next-generation
cutting-edge technology.

1241
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:14,625
Obviously, one giant comet is a major
and existential threat to our planet,

1242
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:20,000
but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.

1243
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:26,625
Our BEADS, that stands for
BASH Explore and Acquire Drones,

1244
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,083
that you see here,

1245
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:30,833
attach themselves to the comet

1246
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:33,375
and scan it with nanotechnology

1247
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,583
developed by
Nobel Prize-winning scientist,

1248
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:37,666
Dr. Gary Talcamont.

1249
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,500
And then we immediately deploy, don't we?

1250
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,833
Nobel and Polonsky prize-winning scientist

1251
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:48,250
Dr. Inez's micro-targeted,
quantum fission explosives.

1252
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:51,625
You see, deep into the object...

1253
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,458
Dr. Inez, would you like
to explain what's happening?

1254
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,416
Thank you, Peter.

1255
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,250
We've been developing
phase-fission reactions

1256
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,375
in the CERN particle accelerator

1257
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,125
that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces

1258
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,333
with breathtaking accuracy.

1259
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:08,791
These segments are then steered
and decelerated by each BEAD

1260
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:13,625
into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation
by waiting US Navy ships.

1261
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:15,666
And when these... Thank you.

1262
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:19,875
And when these treasures
from heaven are claimed,

1263
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:23,916
poverty as we know it,
social injustice, loss of biodiversity,

1264
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,708
all these multitudes of problems

1265
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,125
are just gonna become relics of the past

1266
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:35,625
and humanity is gonna stride through
the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin naked

1267
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,250
into the the glory of a golden age...

1268
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:41,500
And is this nanotech work peer-reviewed?

1269
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,166
Well, I haven't reviewed the data,
but it's been modeled.

1270
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,125
Has any of this been peer-reviewed?

1271
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,833
Nope.

1272
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:51,250
Interplanetary, interstellar,

1273
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:56,125
intergalactic existence
for the human race.

1274
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,916
Your mouth to God's ear.

1275
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:05,041
I understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet,

1276
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,291
it can end world hunger.

1277
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,166
Oh, I see.

1278
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,833
- Why are you laughing?
- That's true. No, I see.

1279
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:15,333
So that's the pretty little bow they're
putting around this line of bullshit.

1280
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:17,250
I bet they'll say freedom and puppies too.

1281
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,166
- All right.
- Yeah.

1282
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,916
You want me to quit the mission?
I'll quit the mission. That's fine.

1283
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,708
But you have to understand,
this is now beyond our control.

1284
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,208
They have all the power.

1285
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:29,958
So who do you want
in the actual room to make sure

1286
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:33,000
this whole thing doesn't turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster?

1287
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,708
Jason Orlean?
You want Jason Orlean in that room?

1288
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:40,125
I have news for you.
It's already a complete disaster.

1289
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,750
They're talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain

1290
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:46,625
hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone company's stock!

1291
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:49,916
You better take that down
about four or five notches now.

1292
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,625
Were you yelling about that mission?
Why were you talking about cell phones?

1293
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:56,750
My friend was just theorizing
as to what's going on.

1294
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,291
We're confused too.

1295
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:01,458
That's an awfully official-looking
White House badge you got there.

1296
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,291
I don't know why I have this on.

1297
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,125
Listen, just tell us what's going on.

1298
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,625
I got three scared kids at home.
Just tell us something.

1299
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,333
I understand.
I wish I could share information, but...

1300
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,958
We're people just like you.
We deserve to know!

1301
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:13,916
They're right.

1302
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,083
They deserve to know.

1303
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,833
Do you really wanna know what's going on?

1304
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:20,041
- Yeah.
- Please.

1305
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,583
- Kate, don't. Kate.
- Kate.

1306
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:28,958
They found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet.

1307
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,166
So they're gonna let it hit the planet

1308
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:36,416
to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich!

1309
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,000
Fuck you!

1310
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,500
No camera!

1311
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,541
Everything I could, they won't listen.

1312
01:15:58,625 --> 01:15:59,958
Surprise, surprise.

1313
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:02,916
Now, I'm starting to think
you just like riling people up.

1314
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,958
I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I am.

1315
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,041
Oh, Randall. God.

1316
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,875
Where's Brie Evantee?

1317
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,375
Shouldn't you two
be playing footsie in a restaurant

1318
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:14,583
that only serves cubes and foam?

1319
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:18,083
Well, she ain't wrong.
You did lose the thread in a big way.

1320
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,375
And what do you suggest we do?
An online petition, huh?

1321
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:24,416
You want to hold...
Get a mob and hold up picket signs?

1322
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,958
You wanna overthrow the government?
I mean, look at this.

1323
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,875
I can't! My head is in a bag!

1324
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:31,583
Sorry, Dr. Mindy.
White House wants her off the grid.

1325
01:16:31,666 --> 01:16:33,166
- Come on, now. Look...
- Now.

1326
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,958
Wait. What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1327
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:38,416
- What does off the grid mean?
- Hey, Kate.

1328
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:42,416
Oh, gosh. Kate! Are you okay?

1329
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:48,833
Teddy, come on!
What choice do I have here?

1330
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,541
A man's always got choices, Randall!

1331
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:56,458
Sometimes you just gotta
choose the good one!

1332
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:04,708
Miss Katelyn Dibiasky,

1333
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:08,208
the charges against you are
violation of national security secrets,

1334
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:11,083
inciting a riot,
and destruction of private property

1335
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:13,666
owned by Bojo Mambo's Shrimp LLC.

1336
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,583
What? I didn't...

1337
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:17,583
However, the Attorney General
is willing to not pursue prosecution

1338
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,208
if you will agree to the following.

1339
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:21,958
The suspension
of all public media appearances

1340
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:26,708
and incendiary language relating to
Comet Dibiasky and BASH Cellular.

1341
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:32,333
Fine. Give it to me.
I don't give a shit anymore.

1342
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,416
Mom. Dad.

1343
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,166
I'm so glad to be home.

1344
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:55,875
Unlock the door.

1345
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,750
No politics. None.

1346
01:17:58,208 --> 01:17:59,583
What are you talking about?

1347
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:02,791
Your dad and I are for the jobs
the comet will provide.

1348
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:07,916
The divisions in this country
are bad enough.

1349
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,458
We don't want more of that in our house.

1350
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,125
- Slow down, kids.
- Sorry, Mom.

1351
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,333
I worry about my kids and their future.

1352
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:22,500
Sure, the jobs
the comet's gonna create sound great.

1353
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,291
What if it's not safe?

1354
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:29,250
Right now, millions of you are having
these same doubts and questions

1355
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:31,208
about the approaching comet.

1356
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,708
That is why BASH Cellular

1357
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,166
in conjunction with
the United States Government

1358
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,041
is creating a new hotline, free of charge,
to answer all of your questions.

1359
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:46,125
And who knows? Maybe,
just maybe, one of our scientists...

1360
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:49,541
Thank you, Sharon.
Makes me feel so much better.

1361
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:53,833
Can be that friend we all need
to lean on during uncertain times.

1362
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:58,750
Call 1-800-532-4500 for peace of mind.

1363
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,458
Offer only available to BASH customers.

1364
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:02,916
Details of your call may be shared
with other subsidiaries

1365
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,916
to enhance your customer experience.
Data and roaming charges apply.

1366
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,416
So, I thought he was the ambassador.
I was just flattering him.

1367
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,541
Well, he was a waiter.
Now he's got an ego the size of Texas.

1368
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,125
Oh, my God.

1369
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,875
June, what...
What are you doing here, sweetie?

1370
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,458
Had a feeling
something was going on and just...

1371
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:31,958
Well, you know,
we're discussing important business.

1372
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:35,458
- That's what we're doing.
- Oh, yeah, that's really very important.

1373
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,750
Oh, can we just
skip past this part, please?

1374
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,500
Where you get to feel self-righteous

1375
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:43,041
and we put our tails between our legs.
It is just so boring.

1376
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,791
Oh, it's so boring?

1377
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:49,291
You wanna skip the part where
you feel bad for screwing my husband?

1378
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:52,583
No, I don't feel bad.

1379
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,416
Randall and I are having a wonderful time.
So, I think the question is,

1380
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:01,791
do we keep having a wonderful time
or does he go back with you to Wisconsin?

1381
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:02,750
Or Montana.

1382
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,875
- Michigan?
- Michigan.

1383
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:12,500
You know... she is actually right.

1384
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:16,333
That's the only question. So...

1385
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,750
Well, June, sweetie...

1386
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,875
Sometimes in life things are, you know,

1387
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,458
they're complicated and they just...

1388
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:27,666
Oh, okay.

1389
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,666
Oh, that was fast...

1390
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:38,375
Well, before I go...

1391
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,375
let me just give you some instructions

1392
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:45,458
on how to take care of Randall.

1393
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:50,541
Yeah, here's the Xanax
he takes for his panic attacks.

1394
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:51,458
Oh, gosh.

1395
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:54,458
Here's the Zoloft he takes
for the crashing depressions.

1396
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:58,250
- Not so much recently. Okay, you know...
- Oh, good for you. Great.

1397
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:02,000
This is for his blood pressure.

1398
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:04,708
- Restless leg syndrome, that's a fun one.
- God.

1399
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:10,875
Appetite suppressant to counteract
the weight gain from his other meds.

1400
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:15,875
And for America's sexiest scientist,
a bottle of goddamn Cialis!

1401
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:17,375
Gosh.

1402
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,041
Goodbye. Goodbye, Randall.

1403
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,916
I guess I'll just tell your sons

1404
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,375
that Dad's fucking
the lady on our television.

1405
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:34,791
June, I...

1406
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,458
I really thought for a second
that was gonna work out.

1407
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,666
People, they wanna
manage the comet to create jobs.

1408
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,791
Thirty-seven percent
don't want the comet to hit.

1409
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,583
That's actually down by three points.

1410
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:50,791
And 23%, they don't think
there's a comet at all,

1411
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,666
and that number is way up.

1412
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,791
Not Bitcoin, RatCoin. RatCoin.

1413
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:01,833
I'd like to buy these sunglasses.

1414
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:12,458
You that girl from live TV
who said we're all gonna die?

1415
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,958
No. What's your purchase?

1416
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:20,250
What the fuck?

1417
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:23,041
- Yeah, that's you. It's definitely you.
- Yep, that's me.

1418
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:26,833
Holy shit. You're a stone-cold legend.
Word is bond.

1419
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:29,583
I got a picture of you on my board.

1420
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:31,041
Picture on his fucking board.

1421
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:33,125
That's great. What's your purchase?

1422
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:36,416
If you don't have one, get out of line
and make room for other customers.

1423
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,791
Can I touch your hair in a non-sexual way?

1424
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,541
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Oh, dude, have some...

1425
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,041
Call Diogo, he'll freak out.
Will you say hi to my friend?

1426
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:47,750
Dude, he's obsessed with you.
We love you. We don't like...

1427
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,250
Can't stand Orlean either.

1428
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,583
What's up? Yo, check out...

1429
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:57,083
Yo, shut the fuck up.
Check out who we're with.

1430
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:59,833
- Yo, bro! What up?
- What up?

1431
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,958
I mean, we have a purchase,
but we don't have payment,

1432
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:05,583
which is a metaphor on...

1433
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,291
- Cash?
- Also, Phillip, I've been told...

1434
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:10,666
- Right.
- That you wrote a book

1435
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:13,458
about your past relationship
with Kate Dibiasky.

1436
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,958
Funny you should say that,
I'm working on that now.

1437
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:18,583
It's gonna be called
A Brush With The Devil, and it's...

1438
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,791
You calling security
or something, with your eyes?

1439
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,125
No. You're free to go.

1440
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:24,333
- That sounds terrible.
- Just like that?

1441
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,125
You don't give a shit, do you?

1442
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:29,958
Sure, I do.

1443
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:33,041
I care about DrinkMo's guarantee
of quality service.

1444
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:35,500
Well, we don't give a shit either.

1445
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:37,208
Not one single shit.

1446
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:40,291
We hang and board behind the abandoned
Burger Crown from 7:00 to whenever.

1447
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:41,208
Yeah, we do.

1448
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,750
You should come hang.
If you're not a fucking pussy.

1449
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:48,333
Oh, you know, it's me...

1450
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:50,958
- Fuck. Okay. Thanks.
- And a bottle of scotch.

1451
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:54,500
It's a joke. But also...

1452
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,083
Okay, let me introduce you

1453
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:16,333
to mankind's savior,
BASH Explore and Acquire Drone.

1454
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:17,500
It's incredible.

1455
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,125
It's incredible, isn't it?

1456
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:22,833
I call this one Primo,
the first.

1457
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:24,416
It's like my first child.

1458
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:31,291
Primo, my boy.
It's your father, Cronos.

1459
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:35,041
Don't be shy. Come on.
You're gonna be a god in the sky.

1460
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:46,583
Are you at all concerned about
the sync on the BEAD explosions?

1461
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:50,583
Oh, Doctor.
There are always questions and fears, and...

1462
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:54,500
I have a report here from a Dr. Inez.

1463
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:57,041
- If you'd just take a look at this study.
- Oh, thanks.

1464
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,333
Listen, a lot of my colleagues,

1465
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,875
they've either been removed
or resigned from this project,

1466
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:06,083
apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here.

1467
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:08,750
So I just wanna make sure that you're...

1468
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:11,875
That you're open
to the scientific peer-review process

1469
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,583
and you're not approaching
this mission like a businessman.

1470
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:16,416
- You know? That...
- What did you say?

1471
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:20,208
- I wanna know if you're...
- Did you call me a businessman?

1472
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:23,916
- You do own a corporate...
- You think I'm just a businessman?

1473
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,791
Do you think you know me, Doctor?

1474
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:30,291
Business?

1475
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:35,125
This is evolution.
This is evolution of the human species.

1476
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,125
- What are you doing bringing this...
- Well...

1477
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:41,375
You know that BASH has
over 40 million data points on you,

1478
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:45,458
on every decision you have made
since 1994, Doctor?

1479
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:50,041
I... I know when you have colon polyps

1480
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,833
months before your doctor does.

1481
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,750
You got four or five
at the moment actually.

1482
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:57,375
You know, they're not of concern,
but I'd have a checkup as soon as you can.

1483
01:25:57,458 --> 01:26:01,916
But much more importantly than that,
I know what you are. I know who you are.

1484
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
My algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types.

1485
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:10,791
You are a lifestyle idealist.

1486
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:15,125
You think you're motivated
by beliefs, high ethical beliefs.

1487
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:20,125
But you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain.

1488
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:25,000
Like a... Like a field mouse.

1489
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:28,500
I'm just trying to...

1490
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:32,875
I just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project.

1491
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,041
I hope you understand...

1492
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:38,250
Our algorithms
can even predict how you'll die.

1493
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:44,375
To 96... 96.5% accuracy.

1494
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:46,333
I looked you up after we met.

1495
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:52,000
Your death was so unremarkable and boring.

1496
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:56,750
I can't remember the details,
apart from one thing.

1497
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,750
You're gonna die alone.

1498
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,791
Alone.

1499
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:09,958
If you'll excuse me, Madam President.
I've got some work to do.

1500
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,708
What the hell are you doing?

1501
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:14,333
- My God.
- I was trying to do my job.

1502
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:17,708
You are just so lucky
that Peter adores you.

1503
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:27,375
You're with the grown-ups now, Randall.

1504
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:29,083
I can't even follow this shit anymore!

1505
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:40,375
BASH got Orlean to pay
the Chilean government, if I'm correct,

1506
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:44,583
$90 billion to let the tsunami
hit off the coast of the country.

1507
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:45,666
That sound right to you?

1508
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,666
Isherwell built
an underground bunker

1509
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,333
for him and all his executives.

1510
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:51,791
No, I heard that
they built an escape ship.

1511
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:55,250
You guys,
the truth is way more depressing.

1512
01:27:56,291 --> 01:28:00,208
They're not even smart enough to be
as evil as you're giving them credit for.

1513
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:08,541
- What?
- No.

1514
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:16,125
Fuck! You're driving me fucking
crazy, Kate.

1515
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,833
Fuck it. We're all gonna die.

1516
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:36,750
Movie will be released

1517
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:40,166
the day that some believe
Comet Dibiasky will impact the planet.

1518
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,750
And the early word is
it's already a classic, Brie.

1519
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,500
Oh, yes.
Well, and what a stellar cast.

1520
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,041
- Devin. Yeah.
- I love Devin Peters.

1521
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,625
He's great. Everything he does.

1522
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:52,708
- What's it called again?
- It's called Total Devastation.

1523
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:56,208
It cost $300 million to make.

1524
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:59,333
- I mean, these movies...
- It's more than you earn.

1525
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,791
Tell me about it.
And my friend Farley, he saw it.

1526
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,625
- He said it's a ton of fun. That's right.
- Well, Farley likes it.

1527
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:07,250
All right, well, what Farley says goes.

1528
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,583
But first,

1529
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:12,458
and yes, you can tell from my smile...

1530
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:13,833
Stop it.

1531
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:18,916
That America's sexiest scientist is here.
Dr. Randall. Welcome.

1532
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:21,375
Dr. Randall, how are you, sir?

1533
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:24,208
I'm... I'm good.
I'm gooder than good.

1534
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:30,833
All right. So, Randall, we're hearing
that there is no comet,

1535
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:34,375
or that there is a comet but it's
a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.

1536
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,750
We are so confused.

1537
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:41,166
So, could you please help us out here,
you know, oh, wise scientist?

1538
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:45,416
Well, first and foremost, Brie...

1539
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,833
there most certainly
is a comet.

1540
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:48,791
All right.

1541
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:52,125
And we know that there is a comet
because we have the data.

1542
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:58,666
There has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late.

1543
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:02,875
You see, the peer-review process
is absolutely essential...

1544
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:05,583
- If BASH's stock...
- For us to get to the facts of... Yes?

1545
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,333
If BASH's stock is any indicator,

1546
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:09,333
we don't have to worry
about the peer review.

1547
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:10,583
It is going gangbusters.

1548
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:13,125
And full disclosure.
I bought as many shares as I could.

1549
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,500
I advise you to do the same.

1550
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:16,333
You are such a shameless capitalist.

1551
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:19,458
Said the woman who will be
in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck

1552
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:22,083
- when I put it in from the stock.
- You know me too well.

1553
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,208
That's right.

1554
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:25,875
Dr. Randall, you sure you're okay?
You want a glass of water...

1555
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,166
I don't feel so good.

1556
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,625
So I think we'll go
to commercial break...

1557
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:33,291
No, Please, Brie. Don't cut away.
Let me say something.

1558
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,916
- Okay.
- You came to the right place.

1559
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,375
We like to say things.

1560
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:40,416
Would you please
just stop being so pleasant?

1561
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,791
I'm sorry, but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever

1562
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:47,083
or charming or likeable all the time.

1563
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:50,583
Sometimes we need to just be able
to say things to one another.

1564
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,083
We need to hear things.

1565
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:57,125
Look, let's establish, once again,

1566
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,916
that there is a huge comet
headed towards Earth.

1567
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,291
And the reason we know
that there is a comet

1568
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:06,833
is because we saw it.

1569
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:10,208
We saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope.

1570
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,500
I mean, for God's sake,
we took a fucking picture of it!

1571
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:15,291
What other proof do we need?

1572
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:18,375
And if we can't all agree
at the bare minimum

1573
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:22,875
that a giant comet
the size of Mount Everest

1574
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:29,041
hurtling its way towards planet Earth
is not a fucking good thing,

1575
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,125
then what the hell happened to us?

1576
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,333
I mean, my God, how do...
How do we even talk to each other?

1577
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:41,208
What've we... What've we done to ourselves?
How do we fix it?

1578
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:44,791
We should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance,

1579
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:48,083
but we didn't do it.
I don't know why we didn't do it.

1580
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:51,958
And now they're
actually firing scientists like me

1581
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:54,666
for speaking out, for opposing them.

1582
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,875
And I'm sure many of the people out there

1583
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:59,958
aren't even
gonna listen to what I just said

1584
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:02,833
'cause they have
their own political ideology,

1585
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,916
but I... assure you,

1586
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,583
I am not on one side or the other.

1587
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:10,916
I'm just telling you the fucking truth.

1588
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,625
This would be a good time to establish

1589
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,250
that Isherwell and the president
have both said

1590
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:16,958
that there's benefits to be...

1591
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:21,750
Right, well, the president
of the United States is fucking lying!

1592
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:24,708
Look, I'm just like all of you.

1593
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:29,833
I hope to God, I hope to God that
this president knows what she's doing.

1594
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:33,750
I hope she's got us all taken care of,
but the truth is,

1595
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:36,875
I think this whole administration

1596
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:41,500
has completely lost their fucking mind!

1597
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:45,125
And I think we're all gonna die!

1598
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:51,125
Look, I just wanna go home.

1599
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:54,125
I just wanna go home.

1600
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,125
I just wanna go home more than anything.

1601
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,583
But if there is one thing,

1602
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:05,291
one thing that I pray...

1603
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:09,833
that I pray that all of you hear
from what I have just said,

1604
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:13,583
is that all of us, all of us...

1605
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:23,625
Why'd you do that?

1606
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:28,250
I really liked you
and I despise most people.

1607
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:33,000
You know, I...
I really thought I loved you.

1608
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:36,958
Really?

1609
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,833
That's wild.

1610
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,625
Yeah.

1611
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:47,416
Ma'am, you need to go.
We gotta get this man off the grid.

1612
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,708
You still there?

1613
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:54,791
No.

1614
01:33:57,291 --> 01:34:01,041
Well, maybe he just gets off
on the power, you know,

1615
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:02,791
like any kind of power.

1616
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:07,750
It's like he knew eventually that I was
gonna find out that the snacks were free.

1617
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,291
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

1618
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,833
- Yeah.
- So it was just like a power play.

1619
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:13,625
Yeah, guys are weird.

1620
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:20,000
I'm starting to think that all this
end of the world stuff is bullshit.

1621
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:22,833
It's not.

1622
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:26,833
It's definitely happening. I've seen it.

1623
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:31,041
I feel like if God wanted to destroy
the Earth, He would destroy the Earth.

1624
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:34,583
You believe in God?

1625
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:39,166
Yeah, I mean,
my parents raised me Evangelical,

1626
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,583
and I hate them,
but I found my own way to it.

1627
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:42,916
My own relationship.

1628
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:48,708
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't advertise it though.

1629
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:55,166
I won't tell anybody.
I think it's kind of sweet.

1630
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:01,333
- Wanna make out?
- Yeah, why not?

1631
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:05,458
Can you not say why not?
It makes me feel like you don't want it.

1632
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:07,458
It's shitty.

1633
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:12,166
- Sure, whatever.
- That's better.

1634
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,833
- Oh, my God, that's it.
- What? What?

1635
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:47,166
- That's the comet.
- What? Where?

1636
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:51,916
- Where?
- Well, that's the Big Dipper.

1637
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,916
That's Venus. That's the North Star.

1638
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,958
- Well, what is that?
- Oh, shit.

1639
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:07,708
What the hell?

1640
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,500
What?

1641
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,583
Come on.

1642
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:23,208
There it is.

1643
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,125
There you are.

1644
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:31,166
There you are.

1645
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:34,250
Is anyone else seeing this?
That's it.

1646
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:38,833
That's it. That's the comet.
Look! It's right there.

1647
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:19,291
- That's, you know, kinda scary.
- Exactly.

1648
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:25,625
- Dr. Mindy.
- Kate.

1649
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:27,875
Doc, you can see it.

1650
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:32,166
I... I'm looking at it right now too.
It's unbelievable. It's...

1651
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:36,250
It's horrific and it's...
and it's beautiful at the same time.

1652
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,041
Oh, my God.

1653
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:45,125
We've been trying to tell you.

1654
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:49,041
We tried to tell you this whole time.
It's right there. It's...

1655
01:37:49,875 --> 01:37:51,458
It's right there, Kate.

1656
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,375
Where are you?

1657
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,875
I'm in Lansing, Michigan

1658
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:00,125
trying to fix things with June,
but she won't talk to me.

1659
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:02,083
- Where are you?
- What the fuck?

1660
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,166
I...

1661
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,291
I'm gonna come find you, okay?

1662
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:10,708
Well, I'm in Illinois.
I could be ready by tomorrow.

1663
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:13,375
- Dearest Father...
- Yeah, I'm...

1664
01:38:13,458 --> 01:38:16,000
As a sinner I come to You
for Your grace and guidance...

1665
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:18,125
They're finally seeing it.

1666
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:20,250
They're finally seeing it.

1667
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:27,583
There it is!

1668
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:45,208
Go outside into your yard,
onto a roof, onto your sidewalk,

1669
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:46,708
and just look up into the sky.

1670
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:50,125
The star's gonna appear fuzzy.
It's got a long streak coming off of it.

1671
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:51,708
That's the comet's tail.

1672
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,375
It's real and it's coming.

1673
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:56,041
If anyone tells you any different,
they're full of shit.

1674
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:57,625
Just look up into the sky.

1675
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,166
It's a fucking fact.

1676
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,708
- We have proof.
- Just look up.

1677
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:04,416
Guys, please just look up, okay?
Screw the manatees and just look up.

1678
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,458
Just look up.

1679
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:07,625
- Just look up!
- Just look up! Just look up!

1680
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:08,708
Just look up!

1681
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:13,083
Dr. Mindy, the president's
plan to save Earth

1682
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:18,125
and make it so we can all have a home
is going to work, right?

1683
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:22,250
Every single man, woman and child
on this planet is going to die.

1684
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:25,541
- I don't like him. He makes me sad.
- I'm sorry about that.

1685
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:27,625
- This is not what we rehearsed.
- Kids, listen.

1686
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:30,875
You tell your parents
that President Orlean and Isherwell

1687
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,625
are sociopaths and fascists!

1688
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:42,708
And do you know why
they want you to look up?

1689
01:39:43,666 --> 01:39:45,416
Do you know why?

1690
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,041
'Cause they want you to be afraid.

1691
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,958
They want you to look up

1692
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:54,708
because they are
looking down their noses at you.

1693
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,916
They think they're better than you.

1694
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,500
Don't look up!

1695
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:02,833
They wanna rob you of your freedom,
and that's a fact!

1696
01:40:02,916 --> 01:40:05,000
Don't look up!

1697
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,833
The US president, Orlean...

1698
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:09,250
Just look up!

1699
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:12,625
Has not included India
or any other nation in the world

1700
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:14,041
to be a part of this mission.

1701
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:17,375
This dude is a known pornographer
named Kip...

1702
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:18,708
Don't listen to that dumbfuck.

1703
01:40:18,791 --> 01:40:24,791
The United Nations have been
considering its own deflective mission.

1704
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:27,125
Just look up, for fuck's sake!

1705
01:40:27,208 --> 01:40:30,958
Now I know a lot of Hollywood
is supporting the Just Look Up movement,

1706
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:32,875
but I haven't seen a pin like that.

1707
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:37,708
Yeah, this pin points both up and down.

1708
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:42,916
Because I think, as a country,
we need to stop arguing

1709
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,500
and virtue signaling. Just get along.

1710
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,500
That is so refreshing.

1711
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:51,208
I think
we're all tired of the politics.

1712
01:40:51,291 --> 01:40:53,458
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1713
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,083
That's why we made Total Devastation.

1714
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:58,291
It's for everyone. You know?
It's a popcorn movie.

1715
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:02,083
You keep your eye on the road ahead,
you put your head down.

1716
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:04,583
And you put
one foot in front of the other,

1717
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:05,708
step by step.

1718
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,083
Day by day.

1719
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:11,375
- Don't look up!
- Don't!

1720
01:41:17,458 --> 01:41:20,500
So we wanna say something loud and clear.

1721
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:24,208
There is no safe way
to bring this comet back to Earth

1722
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:27,000
and exploit it for profit.
It cannot be done!

1723
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:31,458
Nations of the world,
defy Orlean and BASH!

1724
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:36,083
Launch your own nuclear deflection mission
now and save this planet!

1725
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:43,375
And now, there's Riley Bina
with her special guest.

1726
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:45,708
I forgot the name. Thank you.

1727
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:08,416
<i>We knew no bounds
fell at the speed of sound</i>

1728
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:14,416
<i>Riding against all odds but soon
against ourselves</i>

1729
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:20,333
<i>You haunted every memory</i>

1730
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:24,125
<i>With no goodbyes out there for me</i>

1731
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:30,208
<i>Your pride put out the fire
in our flame</i>

1732
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:34,750
<i>Then just one look is all it takes</i>

1733
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:40,458
<i>I feel your eyes,
they're locked on every part of me</i>

1734
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:45,291
<i>And then my dumb heart says</i>

1735
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:49,458
<i>Just look up</i>

1736
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:53,166
<i>There is no place to hide</i>

1737
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,083
<i>True love doesn't die</i>

1738
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:59,916
<i>It holds on tight
and never lets you go...</i>

1739
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,666
Is that a rock-solid ten smokeshow
of a president or what?

1740
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:06,583
If she wasn't my mother...

1741
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:10,041
There's three types of American people.

1742
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,166
There are you, the working class.

1743
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:17,083
Us, the cool rich, and then them.

1744
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:21,625
I'm sorry, but we need them.

1745
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:26,291
We need them because
you build us up to fight them.

1746
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:28,541
The working class, the lower.

1747
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:30,750
- You understand?
- No, I don't get it.

1748
01:43:30,833 --> 01:43:33,041
Do you understand? I'm talking about...

1749
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:35,000
I'm talking about nutritionists.

1750
01:43:35,541 --> 01:43:37,666
I'm talking about personal trainers,

1751
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,125
people at the spa,

1752
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:43,125
but not the ones that check you in
and they're not the masseuses,

1753
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:45,750
but they walk you down the corridor.

1754
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:46,750
They're there...

1755
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:49,333
<i>Know I let you down,
a nigga can't deny it</i>

1756
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:53,166
<i>And there's so much that we're losin',
yes, that matters</i>

1757
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:56,541
<i>I've been dealin' with madness,
wasn't the man you needed</i>

1758
01:43:57,250 --> 01:44:00,500
<i>You dealin' with sadness,
truthfully, it's all on me...</i>

1759
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:04,083
- Divest from BASH when?
- Divest now!

1760
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:05,833
Divest from BASH when?

1761
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:08,875
<i>Time is oh so precious...</i>

1762
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:10,541
We will not be quiet!

1763
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:14,958
<i>Take my hand, baby,
I'll never leave you, Riley</i>

1764
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:19,375
<i>Though what he's really trying to say</i>

1765
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:23,083
<i>Is get your head out of your ass</i>

1766
01:44:23,166 --> 01:44:29,916
<i>Listen to the goddamn
qualified scientists</i>

1767
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,416
<i>We really fucked it up,
fucked it up this time</i>

1768
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:37,333
<i>It's so close,
I can feel the heat big-time</i>

1769
01:44:37,416 --> 01:44:41,000
<i>And you can act
like everything is all right</i>

1770
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:44,791
<i>But this is probably
happening in real time</i>

1771
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:47,791
<i>Celebrate or cry or pray</i>

1772
01:44:47,875 --> 01:44:53,166
<i>Whatever it takes
to get you through the mess that we made</i>

1773
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:58,208
<i>'Cause tomorrow may never come</i>

1774
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:02,625
<i>Just look up</i>

1775
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:06,291
<i>Turn off the shitbox news</i>

1776
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:09,333
<i>'Cause you're about to die soon,
everybody</i>

1777
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:15,000
<i>Look up...</i>

1778
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:23,833
Hey, good afternoon, Adam.
What do I owe the pleasure of this call?

1779
01:45:30,041 --> 01:45:31,041
What time?

1780
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,708
Well... Well, thank you for calling.

1781
01:45:44,125 --> 01:45:45,125
Yeah.

1782
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:02,541
What?

1783
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:06,958
What?

1784
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:14,708
Orlean and BASH
cut Russia, India, and China

1785
01:46:15,958 --> 01:46:17,375
out of the rights for the minerals.

1786
01:46:17,458 --> 01:46:20,916
So they tried their own
joint deflection mission,

1787
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,708
but... approximately 40 minutes ago,

1788
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:33,000
there was a massive explosion detected
at the Russian's Baikonur launch complex.

1789
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:37,666
So it looks like the mission failed.

1790
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,000
That's it?

1791
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:48,666
What do you mean, that's it?

1792
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:53,125
Teddy?

1793
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:57,333
Right?

1794
01:47:03,166 --> 01:47:07,000
There is still the BASH mission.
It's all we have now.

1795
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:15,083
Fuck!

1796
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:30,083
These Just Look Uppers

1797
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:35,833
want millions of illegal Chileans
to come across the border.

1798
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:40,291
Don't look up.

1799
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,291
The hell is that?

1800
01:47:52,416 --> 01:47:54,583
Fucking lied to us.

1801
01:47:56,125 --> 01:47:59,041
The president just texted me.

1802
01:47:59,125 --> 01:48:02,583
Don't trip. It's all good. Don't trip.

1803
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Hey, now.

1804
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:09,250
You cut my face, you fucking rednecks!

1805
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:24,375
Man, there hasn't been
a car in, like, an hour.

1806
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:28,541
Yep.
Everyone's watching the BASH launch.

1807
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:32,333
What are we doing again?

1808
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,416
I told you. We're...
We're gonna go buy some groceries.

1809
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:53,250
The Mills Brothers. Great band.
You know, Duke Ellington found this band.

1810
01:48:55,958 --> 01:49:00,000
I think they were originally called
the Four Kings of Harmony.

1811
01:49:01,541 --> 01:49:05,666
<i>We'll call on each memory
till then...</i>

1812
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:08,208
Till Then, this is the song.
It's about...

1813
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:11,458
It's about soldiers
going off to World War II

1814
01:49:11,541 --> 01:49:13,375
and thinking about home.

1815
01:49:16,625 --> 01:49:17,708
Listen to this part.

1816
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,958
<i>Although there are oceans...</i>

1817
01:49:21,041 --> 01:49:27,041
Although there are oceans we must cross
and mountains that we must climb...

1818
01:49:28,541 --> 01:49:31,541
<i>I know every gain...</i>

1819
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:34,708
I know that every gain must have a loss.

1820
01:49:34,791 --> 01:49:36,625
<i>So pray that our loss...</i>

1821
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:40,708
So pray that our loss
is nothing but time.

1822
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:46,458
<i>Till then, let's dream
of what there will be</i>

1823
01:49:46,541 --> 01:49:49,083
- Okay, I gotta ask you something.
- What?

1824
01:49:51,666 --> 01:49:53,666
Dr. Mindy, can I be vulnerable
in your car?

1825
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:55,125
Yeah, go ahead.

1826
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:58,875
I've never met anyone like you

1827
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:01,166
and I feel a connection to you
on a level that...

1828
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:06,250
I don't know,
I haven't felt with anyone else,

1829
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:08,375
and going out on a limb,

1830
01:50:08,458 --> 01:50:10,458
but would you want to spend
more time together?

1831
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:14,958
Maybe even get engaged or something?

1832
01:50:16,166 --> 01:50:18,000
Are you laughing?

1833
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:20,125
- No?
- I'm smiling.

1834
01:50:21,541 --> 01:50:23,541
- Well, sure.
- This is sweet.

1835
01:50:23,625 --> 01:50:26,875
- Why not?
- This is pretty sweet.

1836
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:41,791
And you read
the tea leaves for Dr. Mindy.

1837
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:43,875
- You showed him the algorithm.
- Oh, yeah.

1838
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:46,041
You really shook him
with that information.

1839
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,916
- How he was gonna die.
- Yeah, it is shaking.

1840
01:50:49,625 --> 01:50:51,916
It got me so excited
to know about my own death.

1841
01:50:54,583 --> 01:50:57,208
I don't think I wanna know.
Yes, I do. I wanna to know.

1842
01:50:57,291 --> 01:51:01,541
You're gonna be eaten by a Bronteroc.
We don't know what it means.

1843
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:03,583
- A what?
- A Bronteroc.

1844
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:07,708
Okay, people, we have clear skies.

1845
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:12,750
And we are a go for the BEAD launch.

1846
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:13,958
Madam President?

1847
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:18,583
Citizens of planet Earth. Now...

1848
01:51:19,541 --> 01:51:23,250
Look at this, Kate. They have wild salmon.

1849
01:51:23,333 --> 01:51:26,416
Look at the difference between that
and the farm-raised stuff.

1850
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:29,708
You see how that looks just...
I don't know. Looks fake, right?

1851
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:33,375
Hey, why don't you go find some...

1852
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:35,958
What are the little potatoes called,
the tiny ones?

1853
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:37,166
- Fingerling potatoes?
- Yeah.

1854
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,750
- I fucking love fingerling potatoes.
- Let's get finger...

1855
01:51:39,833 --> 01:51:41,333
Do you wanna say something too?

1856
01:51:41,416 --> 01:51:42,708
That was beautiful. Yeah.

1857
01:51:43,666 --> 01:51:47,791
What up, world? Jason Orlean,
Chief of Staff, United States.

1858
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:53,458
I've been noticing a lot of prayers
recently for people during this time

1859
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:55,750
and I commend that,

1860
01:51:55,833 --> 01:52:02,125
but I also wanna give a prayer for stuff.

1861
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:08,916
There's dope stuff, like material stuff,
like sick apartments and watches,

1862
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,750
and cars, and clothes and shit

1863
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:16,416
that could all go away
and I don't wanna see that stuff go away.

1864
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,833
So I'm gonna say a prayer
for that stuff. Amen.

1865
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:25,041
Just a quiet trepidation
among this much smaller crowd.

1866
01:52:25,125 --> 01:52:27,000
I can hear the sounds
of some people praying.

1867
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:29,166
Okay, Anderson, let's go get it.

1868
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:32,500
Yes, sir. Here we go, people.

1869
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:34,125
Ten.

1870
01:52:34,208 --> 01:52:41,125
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

1871
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:43,875
five, four...

1872
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:03,500
Hey.

1873
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:05,791
Hi.

1874
01:53:16,583 --> 01:53:19,541
We got some groceries.

1875
01:53:28,916 --> 01:53:30,291
Yo, what was that?

1876
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:32,291
We lost BEAD number 12.

1877
01:53:35,208 --> 01:53:36,833
BEAD number 22 failed to launch.

1878
01:53:37,708 --> 01:53:40,541
It's fine. It's fine.

1879
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:44,666
We had anticipated a margin for error.

1880
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:46,250
Everything is fine.

1881
01:53:46,333 --> 01:53:50,833
I was hoping
we could have a family dinner.

1882
01:53:50,916 --> 01:53:52,291
Hey, Dad.

1883
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:54,458
- Hey, guys. Hey.
- Hey.

1884
01:54:00,833 --> 01:54:01,750
What do you say?

1885
01:54:04,166 --> 01:54:05,000
Yeah.

1886
01:54:05,916 --> 01:54:07,291
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1887
01:54:07,791 --> 01:54:10,000
- This is... This is Kate.
- Oh, hi.

1888
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:11,916
- Hello. Hi, Kate.
- Let me grab those bags.

1889
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,750
- Nice to meet you. I'm Yule.
- Yule.

1890
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:16,000
I'm FirePuma142 on Twitch. You game?

1891
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:18,125
It's really doubtful she knows.

1892
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:19,833
- You're right.
- Who said I game?

1893
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,333
I... I got these for you.

1894
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:27,166
Thank you. That's really sweet, honey.

1895
01:54:33,375 --> 01:54:35,375
I'm so sorry. You have no idea.

1896
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:39,916
- I really am.
- I know. I know.

1897
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:43,875
- I've missed you.
- I missed you so much.

1898
01:54:50,875 --> 01:54:53,625
When we dated in college,
I fucked Aaron Tran.

1899
01:54:57,333 --> 01:54:58,708
Yeah, so...

1900
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:16,833
- That is really good.
- Really good, right?

1901
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:30,000
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey!

1902
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:32,791
- Sorry I'm late, but not empty-handed.
- Hey, my friend.

1903
01:55:33,875 --> 01:55:37,375
Evan, Marshall, June,
this is Dr. Oglethorpe.

1904
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,875
BEADs have approached
optimal escape velocity

1905
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:59,625
and now approaching Comet Dibiasky
and are ready for attachment mode.

1906
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,625
Okay. All right.

1907
01:56:17,708 --> 01:56:20,833
Eight and 27 are lost
due to lateral control malfunction.

1908
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:24,666
Okay, so, now... Now, Peter...

1909
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:28,958
Peter, we're six drones down.
Is this thing still gonna work?

1910
01:56:29,041 --> 01:56:34,875
Well, the engineer's assured me
that yes, 24 drones is enough.

1911
01:56:35,958 --> 01:56:38,958
Well, how many can we lose?

1912
01:56:41,583 --> 01:56:43,083
How many more?

1913
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:50,250
We're being told that several
of the BEADS have exploded on launch.

1914
01:56:51,291 --> 01:56:54,125
Got the head seat right there.

1915
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:56,791
You're way too kind, Randall.
Thank you.

1916
01:56:56,875 --> 01:56:57,875
Big Doctor.

1917
01:56:57,958 --> 01:56:59,166
Do you want more wine?

1918
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:02,291
- Hey, cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

1919
01:57:02,375 --> 01:57:03,416
- Cheers.
- Love you.

1920
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,250
- Love you.
- Thank you so much for having us.

1921
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:06,583
Thank you for being here.

1922
01:57:06,666 --> 01:57:08,208
- It's so special.
- Thank you.

1923
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:24,166
Commence simultaneous
explosive separation stage now.

1924
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,708
Yo. Yo. Mom.

1925
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:40,750
Beautiful.

1926
01:57:41,333 --> 01:57:43,250
- Thank you, pal.
- Yeah.

1927
01:57:43,333 --> 01:57:48,083
Yeah, it really is.
And it's really good to have you home.

1928
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,500
Dr. Mindy got really famous.

1929
01:57:51,583 --> 01:57:54,125
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

1930
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:55,791
That's right. Okay.

1931
01:57:56,708 --> 01:58:00,625
Yep, I was on magazine covers
and everything. I know.

1932
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,375
- You looked great.
- I'll take your shots.

1933
01:58:07,833 --> 01:58:09,458
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1934
01:58:10,875 --> 01:58:13,500
All right. We need a report.

1935
01:58:13,583 --> 01:58:16,166
Need a full status report
on the explosive devices.

1936
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:19,416
Get on it.
Still waiting for a full status report.

1937
01:58:21,416 --> 01:58:22,458
All right.

1938
01:58:22,541 --> 01:58:27,625
President Qi of China
says that the comet is still whole.

1939
01:58:27,708 --> 01:58:29,791
We got four misfires and sync was off.

1940
01:58:30,625 --> 01:58:31,625
It's still intact.

1941
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:32,875
What was that?

1942
01:58:33,541 --> 01:58:35,958
We've got four misfires
and the sync was off.

1943
01:58:36,791 --> 01:58:40,958
Okay. We're all fine. Everyone's fine.

1944
01:58:41,708 --> 01:58:44,791
It's gonna be all right.
If you'll excuse me.

1945
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:46,125
Nature calls.

1946
01:58:46,208 --> 01:58:49,208
I'm just gonna go to the restroom
for a moment.

1947
01:58:52,666 --> 01:58:55,541
Yes, I think
that I should also step out

1948
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,333
to the restroom for a moment.

1949
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:05,583
- Should I...
- No, I'll be fine.

1950
01:59:06,625 --> 01:59:08,125
Sir, the president.

1951
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:11,000
We need to know
what the mission status is.

1952
01:59:13,166 --> 01:59:14,750
She's coming right back.

1953
01:59:15,416 --> 01:59:18,041
Screw this. I'm going to see my husband.

1954
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:24,625
I'm sorry. I've got a 20-year-old
daughter. I've got to go see her.

1955
01:59:25,291 --> 01:59:26,625
I'm doin' an 8-ball.

1956
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:28,833
Oh, shit!

1957
01:59:28,916 --> 01:59:30,625
She's coming. She's coming back.

1958
01:59:37,041 --> 01:59:39,250
Hello, there's a ship.

1959
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:43,916
In case we were wrong,
and clearly, we were wrong.

1960
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,458
Of course you've got a ship.

1961
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:48,125
It holds 2,000.

1962
01:59:48,208 --> 01:59:51,458
It's state-of-the-art cryo-chambers,
and it's set to find

1963
01:59:51,541 --> 01:59:54,666
the nearest Earth-like planet
in a Goldilocks Zone so...

1964
01:59:55,708 --> 01:59:57,125
There's room for you and one other.

1965
01:59:58,166 --> 02:00:00,250
Brie, your wife, your call.

1966
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:09,500
I'm good, but thank you for the offer.
You... You have fun with Jason.

1967
02:00:11,541 --> 02:00:12,500
Jason?

1968
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,375
Oh, shit.

1969
02:00:20,083 --> 02:00:21,083
She's coming back.

1970
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:33,041
I'm thankful for that night
I fell asleep out in the backyard.

1971
02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:36,166
- Woke up face-to-face with a baby deer.
- I remember that.

1972
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:38,708
- Yeah.
- Yep. It was the best day of my life.

1973
02:00:50,166 --> 02:00:51,375
I'm grateful...

1974
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,666
I'm grateful we tried.

1975
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:06,000
Man, oh, man, did we try.

1976
02:01:08,458 --> 02:01:13,791
Well, we're not the most religious here
in the Mindy household,

1977
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:17,500
but maybe we should say amen?
Should we do that?

1978
02:01:17,583 --> 02:01:19,041
Don't look at me.

1979
02:01:19,875 --> 02:01:23,833
I don't know how to...
What, you just say, amen? I don't...

1980
02:01:24,541 --> 02:01:25,750
- I got this.
- Wrap it up?

1981
02:01:26,416 --> 02:01:27,250
I got it.

1982
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:41,000
Dearest Father and Almighty Creator...

1983
02:01:44,875 --> 02:01:48,708
we ask for Your grace tonight,
despite our pride.

1984
02:01:50,416 --> 02:01:54,291
Your forgiveness, despite our doubt.

1985
02:01:57,625 --> 02:01:59,125
Most of all, Lord...

1986
02:02:01,125 --> 02:02:05,791
we ask for Your love
to soothe us through these dark times.

1987
02:02:08,291 --> 02:02:10,500
May we face whatever is to come...

1988
02:02:12,791 --> 02:02:18,583
in Your divine will with courage
and open hearts of acceptance.

1989
02:02:21,833 --> 02:02:24,291
- Amen.
- Amen.

1990
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:27,708
Youse got some church game.

1991
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:30,750
That was beautiful.

1992
02:02:34,166 --> 02:02:36,125
The comet remains intact.

1993
02:02:42,875 --> 02:02:44,541
We just never...

1994
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:50,208
Of course, there's only one story
everyone's talking about tonight.

1995
02:02:50,791 --> 02:02:52,791
Topless urgent care centers.

1996
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,458
Sit.

1997
02:03:06,458 --> 02:03:10,791
Or... we can fuck...

1998
02:03:12,833 --> 02:03:14,666
or pray, or...

1999
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:22,291
Honestly, I think
I'd just rather drink and...

2000
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,916
talk shit about people.

2001
02:03:32,208 --> 02:03:33,833
You'll never take me alive!

2002
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:37,958
Look out!

2003
02:04:30,083 --> 02:04:32,916
I'm definitely gonna have
some more of this apple pie. It's so good.

2004
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,791
It's actually store-bought,
but you really can't tell.

2005
02:04:37,666 --> 02:04:42,208
If I'm to be completely honest,
which at this moment, why not?

2006
02:04:43,208 --> 02:04:46,916
I actually like the junky taste
of store-bought better than homemade.

2007
02:04:47,666 --> 02:04:48,666
You gotta be kidding me.

2008
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:52,166
No, I'm not kidding.

2009
02:04:53,458 --> 02:04:56,666
You know what? I know what he means.
It's like a childhood memory thing.

2010
02:05:31,666 --> 02:05:33,583
Nothing is better than homemade, right?

2011
02:05:33,666 --> 02:05:37,208
This coffee doesn't taste
store-bought. Is it?

2012
02:05:37,291 --> 02:05:39,666
I grind my own beans. Yeah.

2013
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:41,375
Yeah, Dad's kind of a coffee nut.

2014
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:43,708
Every time you have coffee,
you have to grind your beans?

2015
02:05:44,708 --> 02:05:48,666
Randall is very particular
about his coffee.

2016
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:50,375
I can get that way about tea.

2017
02:05:53,208 --> 02:05:55,541
Thing of it is, we really...

2018
02:05:57,625 --> 02:05:59,833
We really did have everything, didn't we?

2019
02:06:02,083 --> 02:06:04,500
I mean, when you think about it.

2020
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:39,916
Hey, oxygen is
actually higher than on Earth

2021
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,166
by nine percent,

2022
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:43,833
so you might feel a bit light-headed.

2023
02:09:44,666 --> 02:09:48,208
And cryo-chambers were 58% successful,

2024
02:09:48,291 --> 02:09:50,583
which is much better than anticipated.

2025
02:09:50,666 --> 02:09:53,791
Yeah, we only had 47 dead
in our section, so...

2026
02:09:54,583 --> 02:09:59,000
I think this is gonna work out quite well.
Quite well, indeed.

2027
02:09:59,083 --> 02:09:59,916
Goodness.

2028
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,625
Look at that beautiful animal.

2029
02:10:05,708 --> 02:10:09,708
I wonder, are those feathers
or are they scale...

2030
02:10:12,708 --> 02:10:14,958
- That's disgusting.
- What is that thing?

2031
02:10:15,666 --> 02:10:18,125
I believe that's called a Bronteroc.

2032
02:10:20,916 --> 02:10:24,125
Whatever you do, don't pet them.

2033
02:17:28,166 --> 02:17:29,166
Fuck.

2034
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,458
Mom?

2035
02:17:47,458 --> 02:17:48,541
Mom!

2036
02:17:54,125 --> 02:17:55,333
What's up, y'all?

2037
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,458
I'm the last man on Earth.

2038
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,125
Shit's all fucked up.

2039
02:18:00,875 --> 02:18:02,666
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

2040
02:18:03,458 --> 02:18:04,375
We out here.

2041
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:08,208
Mom!


1
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,940
<i>Everyone was warned,
but no one listened.</i>

2
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,890
<i>A rise in temperature...</i>

3
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,890
<i>Ocean patterns changed...</i>

4
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,890
<i>And ice caps melted.</i>

5
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,690
<i>They called it extreme weather.</i>

6
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,450
<i>They didn't know what "extreme" was.</i>

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,970
<i>In the year of 2019...</i>

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,890
<i>Hurricanes...</i>

9
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,330
<i>Tornadoes...</i>

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,850
<i>Floods...</i>

11
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,240
<i>And droughts...</i>

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,340
<i>Unleashed a wave of destruction
upon our planet.</i>

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,930
<i>We didn't just lose towns...</i>

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,450
<i>Or beachfronts.</i>

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,300
<i>We lost entire cities.</i>

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,410
<i>The East River swallowed
Lower Manhattan.</i>

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>A heat wave killed two million people
in Madrid...</i>

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,660
<i>In just one day.</i>

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,010
<i>But in that moment...</i>

20
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,690
<i>Facing our own extinction...</i>

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,930
<i>It became clear that no single nation
could solve this problem alone.</i>

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>The world came together as one...</i>

23
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,690
<i>And we fought back.</i>

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,130
<i>Scientists from 17 countries...</i>

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,730
<i>Led by the U.S. and China...</i>

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,970
<i>Worked tirelessly.</i>

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,650
<i>Not as representatives
of their nations...</i>

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,130
<i>But of humanity.</i>

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,010
<i>They found a way
to neutralize the storms...</i>

30
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,050
<i>With a net of thousands of satellites,</i>

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,930
<i>each deploying countermeasures designed
to impact the basic elements of weather,</i>

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,050
<i>heat, pressure, and water.</i>

33
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,410
<i>All overseen
by the International Space Station.</i>

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,490
<i>They gave the satellite net
a technical name...</i>

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,770
<i>But we all came to call it Dutch Boy...</i>

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,730
<i>After the story of the child
who plugged a dam with his finger.</i>

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,130
<i>This is what saved us all.</i>

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,500
<i>And it was built by a team
led by one man...</i>

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,890
<i>My father.</i>

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,250
- Thank you.
- Keep the change.

41
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,810
Jake Lawson. I have a Senate--

42
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,130
Senate hearing in room 12.

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,290
Yeah.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,490
Lawson?

45
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,330
- You're the Dutch Boy guy, right?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,720
Man, I need to shake your hand.

47
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,130
Oh. Okay.

48
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,290
Tornado? Zap!

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,210
Blizzard? Zap!

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,330
Monsoon?

51
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,690
- Zap?
- Zap!

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,530
Everybody down here owes you,
Jake Lawson.

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,210
If you need anything, you just ask.

54
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,210
<i>The Senate Committee
assigned to oversee Dutch Boy</i>

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,890
<i>will now hear from Jacob Lawson...</i>

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,170
<i>Climate ISS Chief Operations
Coordinator.</i>

57
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,730
<i>May the record reflect
that he was nearly one hour late.</i>

58
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,170
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,410
<i>I literally had to
fly in from outer space.</i>

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,250
Oh, here we go.

61
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,530
<i>Mr. Lawson, we find ourselves
heading toward a crossroads.</i>

62
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,610
<i>As you know, as per
UN Resolution 28-14,</i>

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,450
<i>the United States will be
handing over control of Dutch Boy</i>

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,850
<i>to an International Oversight Committee
in three years.</i>

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,970
<i>This in spite of the fact
that we actually built the thing.</i>

66
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,330
<i>Excuse me, Senator.
I don't wanna slow things down.</i>

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,060
<i>You said "we" built it?</i>

68
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,890
<i>Yes, indeed, I did.</i>

69
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,330
<i>Because I know what I did. I'm the guy
who led the team that built the station.</i>

70
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,010
<i>I was up there with an international
crew of 600 people, not just Americans.</i>

71
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,290
<i>And I know all of their faces,
but I don't remember yours.</i>

72
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,330
<i>We had a plumber up there.
He looked a little like you.</i>

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,570
<i>Very clever, Mr. Lawson.</i>

74
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,330
<i>Dutch Boy was an international effort</i>

75
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,050
<i>and, yes, it may, one day, very well...</i>

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,330
<i>...belong to the world.</i>

77
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,770
<i>But until it does,
we have authority over its operation</i>

78
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,210
<i>and we have authority over you!</i>

79
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,690
<i>And you have been flouting
that authority.</i>

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,530
<i>I have report after report here.</i>

81
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,050
<i>Failure to follow procedures...</i>

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,250
<i>Numerous violations
of the chain of command.</i>

83
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,570
<i>Then, there was the incident where you
punched a federal inspector in the face.</i>

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,530
<i>Well, your federal inspector
doesn't know</i>

85
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,490
<i>that a capacitor holds a charge
even when it's disconnected.</i>

86
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,330
<i>He was grabbing for the damn thing.
I saved his life!</i>

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>You can make all the excuses
you want, Mr. Lawson,</i>

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,650
<i>but there's one thing you cannot defend.</i>

89
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,770
<i>And that would be the day
you brought Dutch Boy online...</i>

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,090
<i>...and operational without our consent!</i>

91
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,610
<i>And what would that have taken, Senator?</i>

92
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,330
<i>There were a series of storms building
in Southeast Asia and the North Atlantic</i>

93
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,930
<i>that would have killed
tens of thousands of people.</i>

94
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,770
<i>Dutch Boy was ready. We went green.</i>

95
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,410
<i>It works. You're welcome.</i>

96
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,970
<i>Mr. Lawson, if you continue
to defy our authority...</i>

97
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,130
<i>Dutch Boy will go on without you!</i>

98
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,770
<i>Am I making myself clear?</i>

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,690
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,760
<i>Good. Oh, and one more thing.</i>

101
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,170
<i>To ensure compliance, this committee
will be sending up new support staff.</i>

102
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,650
<i>Naturally, when they get there, you'll
have to send some of your people home.</i>

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,900
<i>We'll leave those choices up to you.</i>

104
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,250
<i>Senator, respectfully,
my crew didn't do anything wrong.</i>

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,570
<i>Excuse me,
I'm not asking for your input.</i>

106
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,970
<i>These people left their homes
and their families</i>

107
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>and risked their lives
to save this planet.</i>

108
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,530
<i>This hearing is adjourned.</i>

109
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,970
<i>I'm not cutting a single one
of those people loose!</i>

110
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,130
<i>Excuse me?</i>

111
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,370
<i>People like you need people like me.
You know why?</i>

112
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,770
<i>So you can take credit
for everything we accomplish.</i>

113
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,970
<i>So you can go to your constituents
and your cronies...</i>

114
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,330
<i>This meeting is adjourned.</i>

115
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,340
<i>...and your mistresses
and puff out your chest</i>

116
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,050
<i>- and say, "Hey, look at me!"</i>
<i>- Sit down, please!</i>

117
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,010
<i>- Well, I'm looking, Senator.
- Excuse me.</i>

118
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,530
<i>- We're all looking.
- This meeting is adjourned.</i>

119
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,650
<i>This meeting is adjourned! Thank you.</i>

120
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,890
Well, that was going well, huh?

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,290
Up to a point.

122
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,890
No, Jake, that didn't go well
at any point.

123
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,490
But, hey, what are you good at,
little brother, huh?

124
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,490
Like working the angles,
smoothing ruffled feathers?

125
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,880
You can fix it. You always do.

126
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,210
It's like a talent.

127
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,170
It is a talent.

128
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,330
Of a sort.

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,530
I wish I could help you.
I really do.

130
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,130
But it's not that simple,

131
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,650
not this time.

132
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,450
Why not?

133
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,450
Well, as of last week,
they have put me in charge of Dutch Boy.

134
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,890
Well, that's great!

135
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,370
That's great! You kidding me?

136
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,930
You're kidding me.

137
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,020
Look, what do you want me to do? Huh?

138
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,850
You leave me no choice. I told you
this had to go well, and it didn't.

139
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,130
I'm sorry, Jake.

140
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,890
You're fired.

141
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,130
Jesus. It's over 120 in this mother.

142
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,530
Fan out.

143
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,690
Hi, Agent Wilson.

144
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,770
Assistant Secretary Lawson.

145
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,330
Oh, you look nice today.

146
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,770
I'm wearing the same thing
I always wear.

147
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,290
Not exactly.

148
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,250
Have you seen I, well, got on a new tie?

149
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,690
I observed. We're trained to notice
any disturbing details.

150
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,210
- Sarah, come on.
- Assistant Secretary Lawson...

151
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,180
I'm not permitted to engage in
casual conversation while I'm at a post.

152
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,610
We are being watched.

153
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,770
We're always being watched.

154
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,930
Well, if we're always being watched,
what's the point of hiding anything?

155
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,570
You're interfering with my duties.
I'd rather not shoot you.

156
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,660
Well, it would be an honor
to be the first person that you kill.

157
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,210
Hang on.

158
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,850
What is it?

159
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,700
Uh, the president's called
a security briefing.

160
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,690
It was not on the schedule,
so I guess I'm now on duty.

161
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,810
I like the tie. Home by 7:00. Love you.

162
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,810
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

163
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,930
I didn't say anything.

164
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,570
Move along, sir.

165
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,890
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,010
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

167
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,730
One of our thermospheric satellites

168
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,690
malfunctioned over Afghanistan.

169
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,570
<i>A UN recon team found it, Mr. President.</i>

170
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,850
And the members of the Climate Council,
they're aware?

171
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,050
Yes, and they've all agreed
to keep the incident discreet.

172
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,610
But with this many people in the loop,
I'm not sure how long it's gonna keep.

173
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,410
And we're sure this was caused
by Dutch Boy?

174
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,570
Absolutely.

175
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,090
Can we assume that this is
an isolated incident? Doctor Quigley?

176
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,410
We're fairly certain, yes.

177
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,010
It's great to know
that you're "fairly certain."

178
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,490
This is a serious malfunction.

179
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,980
So your proposal is what?

180
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,290
Simple. We shut down
all Central Asian satellites

181
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,680
<i>until we know what went wrong.</i>

182
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,170
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

183
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,010
Know how difficult it was to get every
one of these nations online for this?

184
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,650
<i>We have worked extremely hard</i>

185
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,450
to assure these nations that this
system will protect them, and it has.

186
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,330
And let's not forget, people,
it's an election year.

187
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,650
We shut Dutch Boy down,
the press is gonna jump all over this.

188
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,810
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

189
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,650
300 people died in that village.

190
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,090
I mean, who gives a damn
about the politics of it all?

191
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,970
Look, we cost those people their lives.

192
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,980
<i>The only thing we should be concerned
about here is how to fix it</i>

193
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,130
and making sure it never happens again.

194
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,330
And how do you propose we do that?

195
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,330
We can't do anything.

196
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,210
What I mean is, the problem is
not gonna be solved in this room

197
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,530
and, well, certainly not by us.

198
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,210
No, no, we need an international team
on the station itself.

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,650
You know, not suits.

200
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,450
<i>Engineers, coders, builders</i>

201
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,690
doing a comprehensive systems check,

202
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,010
no matter the cost,
no matter the politics,

203
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,010
and we need 'em up there now.

204
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,730
We are set to transfer full authority
for Dutch Boy

205
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>to the international community
in two weeks.</i>

206
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,210
I will not be the president
that hands over damaged goods.

207
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,780
Not now, not ever.

208
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,210
So we are gonna handle this problem
and its solution in-house,

209
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,260
and we are gonna send up one man.

210
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,930
One of our own, who reports only to us
and that we can control.

211
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,440
<i>Understood?</i>

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,260
So find me that someone.

213
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,050
Now.

214
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,780
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,810
Look, I know you're not gonna like it,
but as I see it,

216
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,330
there's only one person
to go after for this.

217
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,130
Your brother, Jake.

218
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,210
Come on, not Jake.

219
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,930
17 countries, hmm?

220
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,820
17 countries had teams working on
Dutch Boy. They all reported to him.

221
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,290
Nobody knows what's under the hood
better than him.

222
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,770
Come on. Can we weigh other options?

223
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,530
Max, how long have you known me?

224
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,410
Ever since I was transferred
to the State Department.

225
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,370
That's right. I handpicked you.

226
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,570
I believed in you. You're smart.

227
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,970
And I was right about you.

228
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,530
I'm right about Jake.

229
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,810
If this is gonna be a problem...

230
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,980
No, sir.

231
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,330
Good.

232
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,370
<i>Afghan satellite
zero-niner-six inbound.</i>

233
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,410
<i>All crews prepare for incoming
Afghanistan satellite.</i>

234
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,050
<i>Replacement satellite
standing by.</i>

235
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,570
<i>Afghan sat is locked in.</i>

236
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,690
Replacement cleared for launch.

237
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,170
<i>And away on sat 5-A.</i>

238
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,450
<i>Airlock doors secured.</i>

239
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,930
I want a full dissection
of all components.

240
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,090
Priority one.

241
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,370
<i>Afghan satellite dissection
commencing.</i>

242
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,050
I will take care of this.

243
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,010
Make sure they depressurize
the fuel intake.

244
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,130
Yeah, we got it, man.

245
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,660
Makmoud. Oi, Makmoud!

246
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm about to obliterate
your top score here, pal.

247
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,610
I have to do some reprogramming.

248
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,930
Oh, come on!

249
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,410
He's got no pride of ownership,
that lad.

250
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,090
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

251
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,970
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

252
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,440
Uncle Max?

253
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,890
Hey! What you doing up there?

254
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,170
<i>What is that? A solar generator?</i>

255
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,730
Dual axis sun-tracking solar generator.
Replacing the power converter.

256
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,250
Oh, God!

257
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,690
You're getting more like your dad
every day.

258
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,890
Hey, where'd he find that?

259
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,210
Are you seriously asking that question?

260
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,250
Oh, of course.

261
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,330
He made it, right? Come here, you.

262
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,370
Ah, it's good to see you!

263
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,050
How you doing? You okay?

264
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,290
I'm really great.

265
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,650
Okay, what's going on here?

266
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,620
All right, this is freaking me out.
You're supposed to be nine years old.

267
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,690
Thirteen.

268
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,170
You were supposed to be
a part of my life,

269
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,930
but shit happens.

270
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,170
Ouch!

271
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,050
So what's going on here?
You living with him now?

272
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,330
He gets me two weekends a month.

273
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,140
Oh, good. Well, how's your mom?

274
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,650
Hmm, justifiably pissed.

275
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,370
I bet.

276
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,090
<i>Hannah, it's time.</i>

277
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,490
What's up, Jake?

278
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,050
Hannah, I thought I told you not
to talk to strangers.

279
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,970
Come on. Don't listen to him.

280
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,730
Your dad and I were your age,

281
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,290
we were so close we had
our own secret code.

282
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,170
<i>- That's true.</i>
<i>- Really?</i>

283
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,090
I don't remember that.

284
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,090
Yeah, you do.

285
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,570
No, I don't.

286
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,570
Well, it was nice seeing you.

287
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,130
Hey, look, you take care.

288
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,930
What's with all the car parts?

289
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,330
I build electric motors
for the retirees down in Vero Beach.

290
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,810
Keeps me busy.

291
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,610
Seems hardly worth your talent.

292
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,010
<i>Kidding?</i>

293
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,580
Having the time of my life.

294
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,250
It's a little early, don't you think?

295
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,850
I got fired by my own brother.

296
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,570
Then I lost my family,

297
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,530
<i>my house, my dog,</i>

298
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,690
so happy hour
starts around 11:00 out here.

299
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,770
<i>Okay, saw your niece,
you don't want a beer.</i>

300
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,730
Road's that way.

301
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,010
There's something wrong with Dutch Boy.

302
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,050
No, there isn't.

303
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,730
Well, an entire village of
dead Afghans may disagree with you.

304
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,930
Yeah.

305
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,370
And then yesterday,
an airlock just opened by itself.

306
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,930
We lost one of our crew.

307
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,730
Dutch Boy is not my problem anymore.

308
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,380
That I am calling bullshit on.

309
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,010
'Cause other than your daughter
and your precious soccer club,

310
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,770
Dutch Boy was all
you ever gave a damn about.

311
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,170
Oh, yeah, once.

312
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,340
Yeah, but you took care of that.

313
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,850
You don't care?

314
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,170
No?

315
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,690
Well, then, what are you doing
living out here?

316
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,530
Hmm?

317
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,610
Look, I know you think I'm a weasel,

318
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,690
someone who just moves pieces
around a chessboard for a living.

319
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,130
Well, guess what, yeah. Yeah, I am.

320
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,490
But that is how you get 17 countries
to agree to build a space station.

321
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,300
Now, you build things, right?

322
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,410
And there is something wrong
with the thing that you built,

323
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,770
<i>and people are dying.</i>

324
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,770
If you really think you're the best,
which I know that you do,

325
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,650
then how the hell
can you stand there and say no?

326
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,600
I'll be taking orders from someone,
I suppose.

327
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,250
Yeah.

328
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,650
So what? Is that a yes?

329
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,290
Long as it's not you, yeah.

330
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,170
<i>Hey, this is Max.
Leave a message.</i>

331
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,540
You got any room in there for me?

332
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,450
Whoa!

333
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,130
Whoa!

334
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,970
Okay.

335
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,730
I think this is everything.

336
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,290
I made you a packed lunch as well.

337
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,930
Did you hear about the gas main
explosions in Hong Kong?

338
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,770
Yeah, it just hit the news.

339
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,050
It's terrible.

340
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,530
Was it anything like what happened
in Afghanistan?

341
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,730
No, nothing happened in Afghanistan.

342
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,560
Are you going back up to space?

343
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,690
- No.
- Yes, you are!

344
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,490
You're leaving today to fix Dutch Boy.

345
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,420
What did I tell you
about eavesdropping?

346
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,370
You've never told me anything
about eavesdropping.

347
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,170
You don't really do much parenting.

348
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,810
How do you know it's safe?

349
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,050
Of course it's safe.
I've been up there 100 times.

350
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,130
Don't treat me like I'm a child.
Someone died!

351
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,930
- It was an accident.
- Someone got sucked out!

352
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,890
It was an accident.

353
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,440
See, that's what I'm going up there
to fix, okay? You don't have to worry.

354
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,650
Hey, think of it like I'm going
on a vacation for a week or two.

355
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,370
To a place 250 miles straight up

356
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,850
and -450 degrees?

357
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,330
Some holiday.

358
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,810
Yeah, you got a point.

359
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,530
Why'd Uncle Max fire you?

360
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,690
Unbelievable!

361
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,810
Did you do something wrong?

362
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,210
No, look, your Uncle Max and me...

363
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,450
It's not just about the one job.

364
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,730
You know, sometimes,
younger brothers resent being younger.

365
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,850
So they get bossy.
They think they know everything.

366
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,170
They tell you how to act, how to talk,

367
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,050
and after a couple decades,
you just get tired of listening to it.

368
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,210
Maybe you should listen.

369
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,570
My lift is here.

370
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,730
- Gotta go.
- What?

371
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,650
Wait, I thought I was
taking you to the airport.

372
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,050
You really wanna see Mom? Great!

373
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,210
We can all fly home to Atlanta together.

374
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,970
Got it covered.

375
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,770
Quit acting like you're mad.

376
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,370
Hannah, what do you want from me?

377
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,810
I want you to come back alive.

378
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,330
And you're not exactly
the reliable type.

379
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,730
Hey.

380
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,170
I know I haven't always
kept good on my promises,

381
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,850
but I'm coming back.

382
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,610
- I--
- Promise.

383
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,380
I promise.

384
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,730
Come here.

385
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,450
I'll be back soon, okay?

386
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,370
<i>OV-104 is now at
T minus one hour and ready for boarding.</i>

387
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,330
<i>We're at T minus one minute
and counting.</i>

388
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,810
Have a safe trip, sir.

389
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,380
<i>Booster rocket
separation confirmed.</i>

390
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,490
Hate to interrupt, Major Tom,

391
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,930
<i>but in a few seconds,
you should be able to see the net.</i>

392
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,730
<i>How's it feel to be back home?</i>

393
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,770
Look at you, girl.

394
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,170
Livin' and breathin'.

395
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,690
Mr. Lawson.

396
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,130
Hey.

397
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,930
Ute Fassbinder.

398
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,330
Nice to meet you.

399
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,100
Yeah, I remember you.

400
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,930
Yeah, you were the German scientist.
You were here when I was here.

401
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,090
Thermospherics, right?

402
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,290
Yeah.

403
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,570
The containment shell needs
a fresh coat of sealant

404
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,200
where the APT ducts push
through the channel housing.

405
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,450
Not good. That's wrong.

406
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,610
And you hear that?

407
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,130
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Listen.

408
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,010
That wobbly hum?

409
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,490
That's a bad step-down transformer.

410
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,210
All these things,
they have to be watched, cared for.

411
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,090
- Mr. Lawson.
- No, I know. It's not your fault,

412
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,650
but when I left,
everything here was perfect.

413
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,930
I need to speak to your Chief Scientist
about the art of giving a shit.

414
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,450
I'm the Chief Scientist.
I've been promoted a year ago.

415
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,770
Right, congratulations.

416
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,570
One of our crew died this week,
Mr. Lawson.

417
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,690
Sorry about the transformer.

418
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,330
Let me introduce you to your team.

419
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,970
Oh, of course, an American.

420
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,290
Actually, my brother and I
were born in the UK, but thank you.

421
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,140
Yeah, but you've got the old
Stars and Stripes on your arm there,

422
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,090
<i>and a cowboy look in your eye.</i>

423
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,170
<i>Oh, no offense.
This is just a serious situation,</i>

424
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,250
and the last thing we need is some
Washington stooge to come supervise us.

425
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,410
Do we, lads?

426
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,730
Well, you got one,

427
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,050
so how about we start
with names and positions?

428
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,410
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,730
Adisa, structural.

430
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,330
Duncan Taylor, systems and OS analyst
and loyal British subject.

431
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,090
Hernandez, robotics.

432
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,650
Dussette.

433
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,610
Satcom and security.

434
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,890
And you are?

435
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,610
This is Mr. Jake Lawson.

436
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,050
You're Jake Lawson? The Jake Lawson?

437
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,650
You look much older
than I would've thought.

438
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,850
<i>I mean, you look good...</i>

439
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,530
...but your physical appearance is not,

440
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,290
does not match the amount of time
that has elapsed in your life.

441
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,450
Am I getting fired?

442
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,060
Okay, we don't have
a lot of time.

443
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,970
So we have three situations to examine.

444
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,490
Afghanistan, the scientist that died
here, and the new incident in Hong Kong.

445
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,570
Hong Kong?
No, that was a gas main explosion.

446
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,890
<i>We all watched that on the telly.</i>

447
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,330
All right, okay.
You just keep believing that.

448
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,090
<i>I, on the other hand,</i>

449
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,850
have a mystery that I'd like to solve
and prevent more deaths,

450
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,810
so feel free to join me.

451
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,890
Or not.

452
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,820
<i>All right, quick question.</i>

453
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,930
<i>Okay, active shooter,</i>

454
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,610
the president and I are both
in the line of fire.

455
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,410
Who do you save first? Me--

456
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,610
The president.

457
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,050
Oh, come on. You could take
a second just to think about that.

458
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,210
Sorry, baby.

459
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,970
Job comes first, same with you.

460
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,610
No, that's not true.

461
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,730
No, I have priorities and you,

462
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,840
you are my priority.

463
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,370
Come on, let's do it.

464
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,450
I kinda want to,

465
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,330
but you just keep talking.

466
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,810
I mean, why do we always
have to be sneaking around?

467
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,570
Come on, let's do it. Let's get married.

468
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,210
We can't.

469
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,290
It's against the rules.

470
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,610
One day, baby.

471
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,090
Um, you're gonna get that.

472
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,810
Because your job comes first.

473
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,890
No...

474
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,810
I'm gonna get it 'cause
I don't want it to interfere with this.

475
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,250
See?

476
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,890
Now I might just not save you.

477
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,970
Yeah, hello?

478
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,500
Max, it's Cheng.

479
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,460
Cheng, God, tell me
you're not in Hong Kong.

480
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,940
- Cheng?
<i>- Last night,</i>

481
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,290
I was right in the middle of it.
It was horrible. That's why I'm calling.

482
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,690
<i>Phone service just came back on.</i>

483
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,330
Yeah, well, you're lucky to be alive.

484
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,170
<i>- I mean, those gas pipes?</i>
- I'm not so sure that was the cause.

485
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,010
What do you mean? I don't follow.

486
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,370
<i>It was abnormally hot
before the pipes blew.</i>

487
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,290
The satellite sensor
should've recorded it, right?

488
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,240
I checked over a dozen times but I can't
access Dutch Boy's Hong Kong satellite.

489
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,330
My access has been blocked.

490
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,970
<i>Check your HoloFrame.</i>

491
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,330
I don't understand.
We both have clearance.

492
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,610
<i>Exactly.</i>

493
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,010
The only people that have authority to
block are in the building you work in.

494
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,010
Wait. What do you mean?

495
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,650
If someone is covering up
a system defect,

496
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,090
there's potential for critical failure
on a global scale.

497
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,410
<i>If Dutch Boy has a catastrophic failure,</i>

498
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,330
it can create something far worse than
the very thing we're trying to prevent,

499
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,690
<i>what we call a geostorm.</i>

500
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,210
What? Slow down, Cheng, all right?
A what?

501
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,680
A geostorm.

502
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,970
Simultaneous catastrophic weather events
triggered all over the globe.

503
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,890
<i>Once they pass a minimum threshold, the
storms will start causing new storms,</i>

504
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,700
<i>like a chain reaction,
until they merge together.</i>

505
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,290
It's gotta be a glitch.

506
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,210
<i>I'll give you a call
when I know something.</i>

507
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,650
All right. Thanks.

508
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,650
<i>These pipes had not been
well maintained or upgraded in years.</i>

509
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,970
Cheng thinks Hong Kong
has something to do with Dutch Boy.

510
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,610
You know, he's implying
some kind of cover-up.

511
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,930
I just got a text and POTUS
called a last-minute press briefing.

512
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,650
What, you can't stay?

513
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,690
Oh, when duty calls, duty calls.

514
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,490
"Neither rain nor snow
nor gloom of night," right?

515
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,370
Honey, that's the Postal Service.

516
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,370
We're the Secret Service.
Secret Service.

517
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,410
Oh, there's a difference?
Really?

518
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,380
I didn't know that.

519
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,810
<i>Grab his laptop. Let's go.</i>

520
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,410
So the satellite that went rogue
over Afghanistan, what type was that?

521
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,490
That's my fave, actually.
I call it a "rock 'n' roller."

522
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,210
Oh, the SR-22.

523
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,290
Uses sonic waves to slow
molecular movement causing cooling,

524
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,730
but, in that case, freezing. Why?

525
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,730
<i>We don't know.
We checked the satellite's hard drives,</i>

526
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,930
but the logs were wiped clean
by the malfunction.

527
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,010
All right. Let's pull up every
"rock 'n' roller" satellite we have

528
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,130
to see if we can find
any corruption in their logs.

529
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,050
Pull up every "rock 'n' roller"
in the net.

530
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,330
There's gotta be more than
1,000 of them.

531
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,210
Ah, 1,270, to be exact.

532
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,970
And we're gonna scan
each and every one of 'em.

533
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,610
Dana. Hey.

534
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,380
Hey. What are you doing here?

535
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,810
What do you mean,
"What am I doing here"?

536
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,650
I work here. I'm your boss.

537
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,650
Yeah, but what are you doing
down from Mount Olympus

538
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,570
and visiting me in Millennial Village?

539
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,410
Well, I have a bit of a favor
to ask you.

540
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,530
You're the best at what you do.

541
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,570
But I need you to keep this between us.

542
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,370
Okay.

543
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,090
I have a problem with my HoloFrame.

544
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,890
Do I look like a Genius Bar to you?

545
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,770
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here
defending the free world

546
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,610
against state operators
and cyberterrorists,

547
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,170
but Grandpa needs help fixing his phone.

548
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,530
I have a problem trying to get through
to satellite G-22 over Hong Kong.

549
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,450
So a satellite has a bad comm.
That happens.

550
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,450
No. No, not a satellite.

551
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,210
All of them.

552
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,650
Oh.

553
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,090
I am mildly intrigued. Stay.

554
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,210
Okay.

555
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,140
It looks like vanilla line disruption,

556
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,250
<i>bad server relay, or trunk failure,
or something.</i>

557
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,490
Are you still dating
that Secret Service chick?

558
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,770
What? No.

559
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,130
No, I'm not dating anyone.

560
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,890
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,890
<i>Wait, look. Oh, my God.</i>

562
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,250
Someone wanted to block your access
without you knowing it was intentional.

563
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,010
But this...

564
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,450
This is very intentional,
and it's very clever.

565
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,940
And I know what you're gonna say.

566
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,170
You're gonna say,
"Tell no one." And I won't.

567
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,810
But I didn't sign up to work here
so I could cubicle-squat 24/7.

568
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,660
So whatever is going on,
I want in on the action.

569
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,810
Well, let's hope there isn't any action.

570
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,640
And yeah,

571
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,850
tell no one.

572
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,290
Miss Fassbinder, we've just been given
a priority communication request.

573
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,970
From Climate Command?

574
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,250
The White House.

575
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,810
All right. So who are the yahoos in
Washington we gotta deal with on this?

576
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,970
<i>I guess I would be the head yahoo.</i>

577
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,610
Hello, guys.

578
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,450
<i>Max tells me you don't have
a high opinion of politicians.</i>

579
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,180
I didn't say that.

580
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,410
<i>Well, neither do I.</i>

581
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,490
<i>We went through hell getting
the world on board for this program.</i>

582
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,340
<i>We've come too far for it to fail.</i>

583
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,170
<i>You and I both understand
why we cannot let that happen.</i>

584
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,570
Yes, sir.

585
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,410
So if I find anything,
I'll report to you right away.

586
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,810
<i>Actually,
you'll be reporting to Max here.</i>

587
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,570
<i>Good luck.</i>

588
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,370
<i>Have at it.</i>

589
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,130
Thank you, sir.

590
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,690
I'll leave you two alone.
And if you need me, I'm in my office.

591
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,490
Thank you.

592
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,290
I'll be reporting to you?

593
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,530
You lied to me.

594
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,890
<i>Again.</i>

595
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,570
No, I just didn't answer
your ridiculous demand.

596
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,890
How do I switch this thing off?

597
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,930
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

598
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,140
<i>We've been having issues down here
accessing the Dutch Boy satcom.</i>

599
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,930
We have reason to believe that it...

600
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,090
Well, it may not be accidental.

601
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,290
Might not be accidental?

602
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,130
Well, I've been trying to access
the Hong Kong satellite.

603
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,370
I knew it. I knew it!

604
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,770
You think it's possible?

605
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,210
Yeah. It's possible.

606
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,610
But even if you could access
the Hong Kong satellite remotely,

607
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,890
you're not gonna get the logs you need.

608
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,770
No. We gotta pull that information
from the actual satellite up here.

609
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,010
Okay. I can authorize that.

610
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,730
I don't need your authorization
for anything.

611
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,010
I'm sure that's really scary for you,

612
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,970
but how about you just count on me
to do my job, and say thank you?

613
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,700
Oh, count on you.

614
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,970
<i>Remember the first time
I had to bail you out?</i>

615
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,970
Oh, God. Jesus Christ!

616
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,570
Yeah, it was just one week
after Mom and Dad died.

617
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,450
You got arrested for fighting. Hmm?

618
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,650
<i>That's when I realized that
despite everything I was going through,</i>

619
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,610
<i>I was gonna have
to be responsible for you.</i>

620
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,260
All right, you know what?
Fine. It is what it is.

621
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,650
<i>I guess I got no choice
but to count on you.</i>

622
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,810
But if you ever authorize anything
without my approval,

623
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,130
you'll be on the next shuttle home.

624
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,690
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

625
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,010
<i>Hong Kong satellite 022
inbound for examination.</i>

626
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,850
All right.

627
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,130
Let's take this thing apart
and find out what happened in Hong Kong.

628
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,640
Bring it down.

629
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,810
It should have come down by now.

630
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,770
<i>What is that?</i>

631
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,490
I have no idea.

632
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,250
- All right, shut it down.
- It's not responding.

633
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,410
<i>Jesus, Hernandez!</i>

634
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,570
Get down!

635
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,660
Get out of here! Go!

636
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,010
Somebody, open this door, now!

637
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,130
Watch out!

638
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,250
Shit!

639
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,570
All right, let's pick up
every single piece of this thing

640
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,300
and get it down to manufacturing.

641
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,130
Do you think we can retrieve
the logs from the hard drives?

642
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,290
<i>Well, the accident created
an electrical short</i>

643
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,330
<i>and fried all the drives.</i>

644
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,170
I mean, look at it. It's toast.

645
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,850
So we've lost all the drives
with possible corruption?

646
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,690
Not all of them.

647
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,610
<i>What do you mean?</i>

648
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,730
I was reviewing your video
of the accident that killed Makmoud.

649
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,540
Each of the panels that blew
has a drive inside.

650
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,410
And one of them got stuck
in the communication tower.

651
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,810
It looks like
the seal locks are still intact.

652
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,570
If we're lucky, the corrupted drive
will still be inside.

653
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,930
We gotta get that panel back.

654
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,370
Yeah, hello?

655
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,130
I just got into DC. We have to meet.

656
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,520
I figured it all out.

657
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,330
Meet me at 10:00 at the place across
the square where we used to have lunch.

658
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,410
<i>Back in college.</i>

659
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,890
All right. Yeah, I'll be there.

660
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,020
<i>Ready to decompress.</i>

661
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,930
All right. Door's open, kids.

662
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,930
You're clear to exit.

663
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,610
<i>Step across the gravity threshold
and follow me.</i>

664
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,730
<i>Let's just get the panel,
see what's on those drives.</i>

665
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,340
Okay.

666
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,610
<i>There's the panel.</i>

667
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,810
<i>Wait. Hold up.</i>

668
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,890
<i>We designed the tower
to have emergency de-rig ports</i>

669
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,290
<i>so the bars can be moved easily.</i>

670
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,850
<i>Control, the panel is secured.</i>

671
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,970
<i>Roger that.</i>

672
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,210
Come back now, kids. Come back.

673
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,690
<i>We're on our way back.</i>

674
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,610
<i>Jake, what's happening?</i>

675
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,850
<i>I don't know! I don't know!</i>

676
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,650
<i>Jake? Jake!</i>

677
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,090
<i>I can't control the damn suit!</i>

678
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,410
- What's going on?
- His suit is malfunctioning.

679
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,810
- Jake, do you read me?
- Duncan, tell him to cut it.

680
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,540
Jake, cut off the fuel intake.

681
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,250
<i>It's not responding!</i>

682
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,050
<i>Hang on, Jake.</i>

683
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,010
<i>I can't hold it.</i>

684
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,370
<i>Eject the pack. Eject the pack!</i>

685
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,970
Oh, Christ. We're gonna lose him.
We're gonna lose him!

686
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,490
Are you all right?

687
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,770
Yeah.

688
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,530
You got the drive?

689
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,130
<i>I grabbed it when I freed the panel.</i>

690
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,810
You smashed up a dozen comm links,
TCAS sensors...

691
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,850
I'm fine, thank you very much.

692
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,410
What happened out there?

693
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,810
Propulsion throttle locked up.

694
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,490
And you lost the door panel,
which means no drive codes.

695
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,410
Back to square one.

696
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,810
Great.

697
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,210
Why didn't you tell them
about the drive?

698
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,570
Because someone just tried to kill me.

699
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,170
I know my crew. I trust them.

700
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,090
You think you know them.

701
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,770
But someone doesn't want us
to see what's on this drive.

702
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,890
Jake,
there's no corruption here at all.

703
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,210
The doors weren't accidentally
blown off. They were programmed to.

704
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,730
- This wasn't a malfunction.
- No.

705
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,290
Someone intentionally killed Makmoud.

706
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,690
No doubt the same person that tampered
with the Hong Kong satellite.

707
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,530
The user logins have been wiped clean.

708
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,490
We have no digital fingerprints.

709
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,850
No. That's what they think.

710
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,410
Login records are synced back
to the mainframe.

711
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,650
Yeah, but that's the problem.

712
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,610
If they're deleted in one place,
they're deleted everywhere.

713
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,530
No, everywhere they know about.

714
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,970
When we built Dutch Boy,
we put in a locked off library.

715
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,370
Something that would track
and archive everything.

716
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,660
Our saboteur's login info
is gonna be in there.

717
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,850
Nope.

718
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,890
You've been locked out.

719
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,330
But by who?

720
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,090
The virtual conference room.

721
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,450
How many have access
to those transmissions?

722
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,930
Anyone with level three access
and above.

723
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,130
Dozens of people.

724
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,370
Max.

725
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,810
- Max.
- What?

726
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,810
Relax. He'll be here soon.

727
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,930
What, really? I seem nervous?

728
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,490
Just a little.

729
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,570
He's here.

730
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,250
He's here?

731
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,250
No! No!

732
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,050
Cheng! My God!

733
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,210
No!

734
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,290
This is Agent Wilson.
Yes, I need an ambulance right now.

735
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,900
- Dupont Circle.
<i>- Max...</i>

736
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,650
<i>Agent Wilson,
I have dispatched the ambulance.</i>

737
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,130
You got me. You got me.

738
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,290
I'm here. Look at me. Look at me.

739
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,410
Zeus. Zeus.

740
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,010
What?

741
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,410
<i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

742
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,450
Max? You okay?

743
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,570
They said it was urgent.
What is it?

744
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,330
Yeah. Um...

745
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,770
I wanted to apologize.

746
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,170
Apologize?

747
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,490
If you had any idea
what I just walked away from...

748
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,700
You're gonna drag me up here
just to apologize?

749
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,810
<i>All right. Fine.</i>

750
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,130
Apology accepted.

751
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,530
Hey, Max, we don't walk out
on each other.

752
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,090
That's the unspoken code
between brothers.

753
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,730
<i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i>

754
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,930
Yeah, he dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne.

755
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,800
Proof the Lawsons aren't fishermen.

756
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,370
<i>Four hours,</i>

757
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,570
the three of us didn't catch a thing.

758
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,370
I tried to sabotage Dad's reel
so we could leave.

759
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,970
That pin
at the highest part of the spool,

760
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,210
<i>pulled it so the level mechanism
would pop out.</i>

761
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,090
Of course, Dad was a government spy
his whole life, caught me red-handed.

762
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,250
"Trust me," he said.
"I get it. No one likes to fail.

763
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,440
<i>"But I'd rather not catch fish
with my family</i>

764
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,610
<i>"than catch 20 fish alone."</i>

765
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,330
I didn't even understand
what he meant back then.

766
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,890
But I do now.

767
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,810
<i>Take care, Max.</i>

768
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,610
End transmission.

769
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,090
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

770
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,450
What was all that?

771
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,490
That was the first decent conversation
we've had in years.

772
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,210
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

773
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,730
Would you relax?

774
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,890
What?

775
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,450
Do you have a moment?

776
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,330
Yes! I do. I got your message.

777
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,530
Jesus.

778
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,530
What happened?
Did Secret Service Barbie dump you?

779
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,690
I need to show you something.

780
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,850
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

781
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,880
<i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i>

782
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,770
<i>He dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne.</i>

783
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,330
Our dad never took us fishing.

784
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,930
Oh.

785
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,930
That's sad.

786
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

787
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,730
I'm not good at the, like,
"Talk about your daddy issues"

788
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,010
kind of friend thing. I just...

789
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,290
What? No, no, no...

790
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,730
It's a code.

791
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,690
"He dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne."

792
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,170
His cell phone number is the key.

793
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,810
Take a look at the digits.

794
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,820
Okay, you got your first number,
that's your first word.

795
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,170
Second number, nine,
you move on nine words.

796
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,210
- That's your second word.
- Mmm-hmm.

797
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,250
Third number, nine again.

798
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,250
Another nine, you move on. Then nine,
then two, then nine, then five,

799
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,370
and so on and so on until you get
an entirely different message.

800
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,130
Oh. So, who came up
with this encryption, a 12-year-old?

801
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,410
No. I was 13.

802
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,810
Okay.

803
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,250
So, one-nine-nine-nine,

804
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,490
<i>two-nine-five-five,</i>

805
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,370
eight-seven-one and go.

806
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,330
<i>Proof of sabotage at
the highest level of government.</i>

807
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,930
<i>Trust no one.</i>

808
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,850
Well, you said
you were looking for action.

809
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,250
Uh, yeah, but I mean, holy shit.

810
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,090
If you don't wanna take this any
further, I totally understand.

811
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,530
No. I do, I do. I just...

812
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,010
I do and I don't.

813
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,050
Kinda like going on a rollercoaster
or eating Chipotle.

814
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,530
What's our next move?

815
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,450
Okay. I need you to find anything
you can on a file named "Project Zeus."

816
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,650
"Project Zeus"?

817
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,850
Yeah.

818
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,770
Okay. Looks like we have ourselves
a bro-spiracy theory.

819
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,570
- Just run the damn search.
- Yeah.

820
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,130
Um...

821
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,340
I am getting a hit.

822
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,450
Um...

823
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,810
But it looks like it's double encrypted.
It's a little OCD.

824
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,290
Can you break it?

825
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,140
Yeah, I could,

826
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,170
but I can't do it from here.

827
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,090
The file's under a White House security
network, and it's just not hackable.

828
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,090
I'd have to log in,
and I don't have the credentials for it.

829
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,690
Shit. Neither do I.

830
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,130
I don't know anyone who does.

831
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,250
Yeah, you do.

832
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,570
Max?

833
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,250
Freeze.

834
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,690
Oh! Holy shit!

835
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Honey, relax!

836
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,460
Who is this girl in our house?

837
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,180
I can explain everything.

838
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,770
Mmm, that sounds really pervy.

839
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,380
- Shut up.
<i>- Okay, I'm sorry. I will.</i>

840
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,260
I broke one of your wine glasses. Um...

841
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,690
It just fell and I promise
I'm gonna reimburse you.

842
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,570
I have the money. I'm sorry.

843
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,770
Talk.

844
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,850
This is Dana.
She works with me in State.

845
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,370
Now, I asked her here
because I need her help,

846
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,410
and as it turns out,
I need your help, too.

847
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,730
She's hot!

848
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,930
<i>I know how much
your job means to you.</i>

849
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,330
I took an oath, Max.

850
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,210
We have rules.

851
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,940
Technically, you're not supposed
to be sleeping together either--

852
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,370
Dana.

853
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,450
You're asking me to commit a crime.

854
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,170
You're soliciting a Secret Service agent
to break into the White House server

855
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,130
<i>and illegally obtain files.</i>

856
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,090
And you thought I would say yes!

857
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,290
- I still think you're gonna say yes.
- Why?

858
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,610
Because I'm the one who's asking you.

859
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,570
And if I'm asking you,

860
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,770
well, then it must be important.

861
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,780
And you know that it's bigger
than you and me.

862
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,930
"You and I."

863
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,130
Shut up.

864
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,730
Sarah, please.

865
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,850
One time.

866
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,920
We need to play back the security
cameras without alerting anyone.

867
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,890
Someone killed Makmoud.

868
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,090
We find out why,
we know who's behind this.

869
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,020
But you can't access the cameras
without it being logged in.

870
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,130
That's why we're going to the back-up
server room.

871
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,850
You see? It comes in handy
that I built the place.

872
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,650
Yes, but I live here.

873
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,850
Show off.

874
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,290
Makmoud was prepping diagnostics
on the Afghan sat

875
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,060
while we launched a replacement.

876
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,130
Son of a bitch.

877
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,410
He pulled something off the sat.

878
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,330
Poor bastard figured it out,

879
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,250
and they killed him to make sure
no one else did.

880
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,010
<i>There are no cameras allowed
in the locker rooms.</i>

881
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,410
Then let's go take a look for ourselves.

882
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,210
181.

883
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,490
181.

884
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,890
What's the code?

885
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,860
Seven, six, three, six, three.

886
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,530
<i>What do you think
you're doing?</i>

887
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,650
You know what happened to me out there
wasn't an accident.

888
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,930
<i>Whoever did that</i>

889
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,450
killed Makmoud.

890
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,610
And what makes you think it is not me?

891
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,770
Because if it was you,
I'd be dead already.

892
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,730
Dussette, lower your gun.

893
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,090
Whatever you're looking for,

894
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,740
it is not in this locker.

895
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,090
I was here when Makmoud came in.

896
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,890
He put his stuff in an empty one.

897
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,370
Why didn't you tell me?

898
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,250
You watched the same
security footage as I did.

899
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,530
I was just waiting to see who was
gonna come and look for Makmoud's stuff.

900
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,290
It's in here.

901
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,130
<i>Two, six, six, five, three.</i>

902
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,410
Bingo.

903
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,650
This is everything he copied
off the satellite onto his HoloFrame.

904
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,090
<i>That's a virus.</i>

905
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,650
That wasn't generated by the satellite's
onboard computer.

906
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,410
Because they were planted.

907
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,770
Makmoud found the virus and got killed
before he could tell anyone.

908
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,450
<i>Oh, I got it.
All right, here we go.</i>

909
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,250
Project Zeus.

910
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,370
There are tens of thousands of
storm simulations in here,

911
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,450
and each one is starting
in a different place.

912
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,410
<i>They all end the same way.</i>

913
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,170
A geostorm.

914
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,770
I mean, unlike anything we've ever seen.

915
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,490
Dana, can you show us just the
simulation that begins in Afghanistan?

916
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,530
Yeah, sure.

917
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,530
<i>Okay, now filter those</i>

918
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,300
so that the second malfunction's
over Hong Kong.

919
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,770
Where are you going with this?

920
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,170
What if Cheng realized that someone
was following one of his scenarios?

921
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,970
You know, making it look like
a predicted pattern of malfunction,

922
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,840
disguising a crime
like a series of accidents.

923
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,250
It might actually be
a series of accidents.

924
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,770
If it were,
they wouldn't have killed him.

925
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,320
Someone has weaponized Dutch Boy.

926
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,850
<i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

927
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,010
<i>Hey.</i>

928
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,930
New face?

929
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,610
Yeah. A friend.

930
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,010
Uh, she's keeping things off
the monitor channels,

931
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,170
<i>so we're good.</i>

932
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,610
- So you got my message?
<i>- Yeah, I got your message.</i>

933
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,980
It's, uh... It's worse than we thought.

934
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,810
Whoever's doing this is using
Dutch Boy to target cities.

935
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,820
Yeah, they're disguising their moves
as malfunctions.

936
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,930
They already killed the man
who found out about this,

937
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,420
and I don't think they're done.

938
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,850
Yeah.

939
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,690
This was my life's work, Max.

940
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,650
You know, they said it was impossible,

941
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,890
but we pulled it off.

942
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,370
And it worked

943
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,650
perfectly, without fail,
day after day, year after year.

944
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,450
So what do people do with it?

945
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,260
Turn it into a gun.

946
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,410
<i>I know.</i>

947
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,170
<i>I know. It's not too late.
We can fix this</i>

948
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,980
before it happens again,
but I can't do it on my own.

949
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,010
I need you. I need you to tell me,
how are they controlling Dutch Boy?

950
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,770
- I know how they're controlling it.
<i>- How?</i>

951
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,330
A virus.

952
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,050
<i>Well, can you stop it?</i>

953
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,210
There's only one way.

954
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,130
We can shut down Dutch Boy temporarily.

955
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,090
The reboot will flush out the system,

956
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,820
kill the virus, and revert back
to the fail-safe OS.

957
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,650
Okay. Let's do it.

958
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,130
I'm authorizing.

959
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,530
Yeah, I think we've established
that I don't really wait for that.

960
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,690
This isn't a Chromebook.

961
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,450
You don't just put your finger
on the power button.

962
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,090
You need the kill codes.

963
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,210
And the only one who has those
is the president.

964
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,610
So let's just go to the president
and tell him what we know.

965
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,090
No. You can't go to Palma.

966
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,490
<i>We need way more proof than I have.</i>

967
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,170
We're talking about shutting down
Dutch Boy.

968
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,720
I mean, even for an hour,
that puts the whole planet at risk.

969
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,890
No, I don't think you understand.

970
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,250
Someone sealed off the backdoor
into the system.

971
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,610
A backdoor almost no one knew existed.

972
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,380
But the president did.

973
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,080
No. Jake, come on. What?

974
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,570
Are you out of your mind?

975
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,410
Not saying it's him. I'm saying,
"What if?"

976
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,610
Who else has the resources
to pull this off?

977
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,020
Murder, cover-up, a virus that can only
be stopped with the codes in his pocket.

978
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,330
Why? Huh? Tell me, why?
Why would he do that?

979
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,250
We're two weeks away from transferring
Dutch Boy to the rest of the world.

980
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,980
Two weeks away from losing
autonomous control.

981
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,450
Now, he talks a good game,
but he's never gonna let it happen.

982
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,330
A series of disasters,
an international crew to take the fall,

983
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,690
and he'll have to cancel the hand off.

984
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,610
And who would blame him?

985
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,370
All right. You stay on top
of your satellites.

986
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,410
Max.

987
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,330
Max, don't do anything stupid.

988
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,370
Let's go.

989
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,530
<i>Okay? They already
tried to kill me once.</i>

990
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,130
Max!

991
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,690
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

992
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,330
<i>President Palma,
a couple questions, please, sir.</i>

993
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,420
<i>Thoughts before you head to
the national convention in Orlando, sir?</i>

994
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,040
<i>Mr. President, do you care
to make a statement?</i>

995
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,410
<i>Mr. President, a moment
before you head to Orlando?</i>

996
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,610
My friends
from Washington, D.C.

997
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,930
<i>I could never get on a plane without
saying hello to you. It's impossible.</i>

998
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,410
What are you doing here?

999
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,490
- Are you insane?
- Sarah, look.

1000
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:39,210
Jake needs us to
steal the kill codes from Palma.

1001
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,290
Us?

1002
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,370
You're asking me to help you
on the word of your asshole brother,

1003
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,050
who you haven't even spoken to
for three years.

1004
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,890
Yeah.

1005
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:50,050
Think about it. Afghanistan, Hong Kong,
Cheng, the crazy sim shit,

1006
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,930
the death on the space station. Come on.

1007
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,050
Look, you gotta trust me on this,
all right? I'm not kidding around here.

1008
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,130
- Okay.
- Look.

1009
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,810
The codes are on Palma's HoloFrame.

1010
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,970
We can't do it on the plane.

1011
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:05,850
Why not?

1012
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,730
Too many eyes. He's never alone.

1013
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,730
All right, then what's the play?

1014
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:15,250
Palma wants some private time to shower
and make calls before the after-parties.

1015
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:16,650
You follow. I'll get you inside.

1016
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,530
I can steal the codes while he's
in the shower.

1017
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,610
- That's the idea.
- Yes, it is.

1018
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,810
<i>- Warning.</i>
- Out of the way.

1019
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,130
<i>All satellite communication offline.</i>

1020
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,610
<i>All satellite communication offline.
All crew report to stations immediately.</i>

1021
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,690
Oh, my God.

1022
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,810
We have nearly 200 satellites
reporting malfunctions,

1023
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,660
most of them nearing critical.

1024
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,770
Pull up the satellite closest to
critical overload.

1025
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,850
We've lost all control
of the Tokyo satellite.

1026
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,610
<i>Max.</i>

1027
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,250
I didn't know you were coming
to the convention.

1028
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,050
Yeah. You know,
my dad lives in Florida,

1029
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,930
so I promised I'd get him
into the convention.

1030
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:21,800
We need every vote, right?

1031
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,930
Yeah, well, bring him to the green room.
We'll do a little photo op.

1032
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,810
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
Thank you.

1033
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,850
We've got reports of extreme weather
anomalies building

1034
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,370
over Brazil, Mexico, Bucharest,
and Belgrade.

1035
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,200
There's over 1,000 storm warnings
issued around the world.

1036
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,170
<i>Rio de Janeiro satellite critical.</i>

1037
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,330
<i>Retrieval routine offline.</i>

1038
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,810
Chart a new course!

1039
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,290
Get us close to the nearest satellites
going critical.

1040
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,770
- What are you trying to do?
- We're gonna launch the replacements.

1041
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,090
- As many as we can, as fast as we can.
- Wait, wait, wait...

1042
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,290
We have to retrieve the other
satellites first.

1043
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,890
Or the replacements will crash
into them.

1044
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,370
They're programmed to arrive

1045
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,810
in the exact same destination.

1046
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,970
And they'll knock out
the infected satellites.

1047
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,280
- Yeah.
- Of course!

1048
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,130
<i>All crews report to stations</i>

1049
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,810
<i>for Rio satellite replacement.</i>

1050
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,730
<i>Go for launch.</i>

1051
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,450
Away she goes.

1052
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,370
<i>Satellite replacement for Rio

<i>Warning. Satellite on collision course.</i>

1054
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,210
Disable the retro-boosters.

1055
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,570
Don't let it slow down.

1056
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,130
Load 'em up and keep 'em coming!

1057
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,940
<i>Warning. Geostorm alert.</i>

Four more years!
Four more years!

1060
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,220
<i>Thank you. As you know,
the environment</i>

1061
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,920
<i>was my late wife's
great passion and purpose.</i>

1062
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,130
<i>And I know that she would be
extremely proud...</i>

1063
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,250
<i>Caused by
the worst hailstorm in recorded history.</i>

1064
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,050
<i>There has been another extreme weather
event, this time in Rio de Janeiro.</i>

1065
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:45,290
<i>An offshore cold front moved rapidly
across land,</i>

1066

<i>plunging the city into
dangerously low temperatures.</i>

1067
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,890
<i>There are reports
of numerous casualties,</i>

1068
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,210
<i>but we don't know how many at this time.</i>

1069
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,490
<i>We're also hearing that a cargo plane</i>

1070
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:57,610
<i>may have crashed in the city itself,
possibly related to the freezing cold.</i>

1071
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:01,610
<i>Tokyo and Rio are the first catastrophic
events since the launch of Dutch Boy.</i>

1072
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,770
<i>Stay tuned after the break, when we'll
be joined by our reporter Sally Jones.</i>

1073
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,050
Oh, God.

1074
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,330
<i>Hey, Max!</i>

1075
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:17,770
Where's your daddy?

1076
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,380
Oh. Uh...

1077
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,970
You know what? He got so caught up
in all the excitement.

1078
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,170
I recruited you for this position.

1079
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,690
I know everything about you.
Your brother, and your mother's death,

1080
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,290
your father's death, everything.

1081
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,970
Why'd you lie to me, hmm?
Why'd you insist on making this trip?

1082
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,640
Tell me what's wrong.

1083
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,810
Maybe I can help you, maybe I can't.

1084
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,090
All right, look.

1085
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,250
I gotta tell you something. Come here.

1086
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:50,700
We are 90 minutes away from
a global storm we won't recover from.

1087
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,890
And I need the president's kill codes.

1088
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:55,850
Come again?

1089
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,650
We gotta shut Dutch Boy down, now.

1090
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,010
You're serious.

1091
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,410
You say you hired me
because you believe in me, right?

1092
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,860
All right, well, I need you
to believe in me now.

1093
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,450
Well, we've gotta brief the president.
Get to Cape Canaveral.

1094
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,050
No, no, no. We can't do that, sir.

1095
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,090
Why not?

1096
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,450
I believe he's the one who initiated it.

1097
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,170
<i>United we stand.</i>

1098
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,290
<i>United we can.</i>

1099
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,090
Four more years! Four more years!

1100
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,900
You better be goddamn sure of yourself,
making accusations like that.

1101
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,370
With all due respect, we don't have time
to argue about this.

1102
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,690
Palma and I go way back.
Why would he do that? That's insane.

1103
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,970
Yeah, well, he's doing it.

1104
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,130
What's your proof?

1105
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,170
Yeah, I got proof.
Dozens of files, all right?

1106
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,290
In Project Zeus. It's all there.

1107
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,690
Well, we can't get the kill codes
from the president.

1108
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,170
Why not?

1109
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,810
Because the president is the kill codes.

1110
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,410
Biometrics. Ten fingerprints,
two retina scans.

1111
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,570
Well, what do we do?

1112
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,250
I'll have to reason with him.
We'll have to reason with him.

1113
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,490
Satellites are
going critical over Florida.

1114
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,050
Load a replacement sat, now.

1115
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:11,810
<i>Station
self-destruct sequence initiated.</i>

1116
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,050
<i>Phase one commencing now.</i>

1117
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,610
Okay. Shut that down!

1118
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,010
I can't. I'm locked out.

1119
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,930
We built in backdoor overrides.

1120
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,930
Yeah, I'm trying them.

1121
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,810
<i>If we lose the station, we won't be able
to control the satellites.</i>

1122
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,810
Self-destruct?

1123
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,490
Why would you build that
into the station?

1124
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,370
In case it fell to Earth.

1125
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,850
Where's Duncan?

1126
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,410
He's the one with enough programming
expertise to override the commands.

1127
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,250
Duncan.

1128
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,290
<i>That's the fuel tanks.</i>

1129
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:48,570
They're the first to go.

1130
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,050
Then section by section
until command and retrieval.

1131
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,130
Okay, everybody, get to the shuttles!

1132
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,050
<i>Evacuate!</i>

1133
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,410
Come on, we gotta hurry! Go, go, go!

1134
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,930
Jake, what are you still doing here?

1135
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,770
That felt good.

1136
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,170
Been wanting to do that
since I first met you.

1137
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,530
Have you gone mad?

1138
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,730
Yeah, pretty much.

1139
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,340
The virus.

1140
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,880
You're the only one that could have
put it in the system.

1141
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,050
You're the only one who could've
sealed off the backdoor.

1142
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,490
The only one that could've helped
to pull this off.

1143
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:29,530
I need the overrides for the
self-destruct to the station, now!

1144
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:30,930
I mean, what for?

1145
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,770
I'm not gonna be here when it blows.

1146
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,970
But you will.

1147
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,410
Come on, man. Why'd you do it?

1148
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:43,620
Well, you know what us
lowly scientists get paid?

1149
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,130
Take that times 1,000.

1150
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,370
What difference is it gonna make?

1151
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,890
If you don't stop, there's not gonna be
a planet to spend it on.

1152
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,680
Please. We're gonna keep
all the best bits.

1153
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,970
Aren't you a little bit curious
to watch the world burn?

1154
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,610
No. 'Cause millions of people
are gonna die.

1155
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,570
And one of them's my daughter.

1156
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,010
Oh, shit.

1157
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,970
Holding room for the president
down on the left.

1158
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,370
We'll confront him there.

1159
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,090
Project Zeus.

1160
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,250
Did Cheng tell you anything else?

1161
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,490
Cheng?

1162
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:09,010
<i>But this president
knows that hope is not a plan.</i>

1163
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,490
<i>This president knows</i>

1164
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,260
<i>that despite how far we've come,</i>

1165
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,450
<i>there is much more work ahead.</i>

1166
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,210
<i>Working to save our planet</i>

1167
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,290
<i>is my first priority as vice president.</i>

1168
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,610
<i>This is but a stepping stone
to the success</i>

1169
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:30,450
<i>and greatness that can and will be
the future of our society.</i>

1170
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,410
Excuse me.

1171
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,380
<i>That's why I'm here tonight with
the Speaker of the House,</i>

1172
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,130
<i>the Senate pro tempore,
and President Palma's whole cabinet.</i>

1173
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,370
<i>We all stand united in support...</i>

1174
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,850
Palma doesn't leave the building.

1175
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,440
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

1176
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,210
Where have you been?

1177
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,850
Come here.

1178
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,050
It's not the president, all right?
It's Dekkom.

1179
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,170
Dekkom? How do you know?

1180
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,410
Because he just tried to kill me.
That's how I know.

1181
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:01,130
Look, the sim shows Orlando
is the next city to be hit.

1182
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,330
Here? Why would he do that?

1183
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,330
Because Dekkom wants Palma
trapped here, all right?

1184
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,610
And everyone else who's next in line
for the presidency.

1185
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,930
Are we still stealing the codes?

1186
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,890
The president is the kill codes,
all right? They're biometric.

1187
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,290
If Palma dies,
Dutch Boy can't be stopped.

1188
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,850
Sure, kidnap the president.
That sounds like the reasonable move.

1189
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,610
Yeah, well,
it's the only move we've got.

1190
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,570
Unless you wanna steal his fingers
and his eyes.

1191
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,730
Huh?

1192
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,660
We go now.

1193
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,250
You get us a car.

1194
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,410
I'll get us a president.

1195
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,090
All right, good.

1196
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,730
<i>The program did not gain</i>

1197
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,850
<i>the immense
international support that it...</i>

1198
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:48,330
Gunman spotted. POTUS is compromised.
Evac to secure location Alpha.

1199
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:50,850
Get him out, get him out!

1200
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,690
Go, go, go.

1201
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,890
Secret Service! Get back! Get back!

1202
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,330
You got a 20 on the shooters?

1203
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,060
Front mezzanine by exit 212!
Two men with automatics!

1204
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,540
- I'm on it! You get POTUS!
- You two,

1205
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,330
secure this entrance!
No one comes down this hallway!

1206
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,530
Nobody gets through! Hard room, Lammy.

1207
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,610
- Got it!
- You two,

1208
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,260
clear the emergency exit now!

1209
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:32,930
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1210
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,050
You need to come with me.

1211
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,290
<i>This exit is off limits!</i>

1212
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,330
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

1213
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,090
Seriously? A self-driving cab?

1214
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,490
Dana jacked it remotely.
It was all I could get.

1215
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:49,850
What the hell's going on here, Lawson?

1216
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,370
Please, sir. Look, I'll explain
everything in the car.

1217
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,010
Please, sir! We don't have much time!

1218
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,770
Keep moving! Get to the shuttles!

1219
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,450
Keep going!

1220
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,810
Quick!

1221
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,770
<i>Time to geostorm, 55 minutes.</i>

1222
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,970
Sir, I can barely hear you.
The storm is causing too much static.

1223
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,740
<i>The Secret Service
will be homing in</i>

1224
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,850
<i>on the beacon
on the president's HoloFrame.</i>

1225
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,620
You have got to get to him
before they do.

1226
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,810
Under no circumstances can he make it
out of Orlando.

1227
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,770
<i>Our man on the space station
did his job.</i>

1228
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,970
<i>- Now you do yours.</i>
- Copy that. Got it.

1229
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,010
- Dekkom?
<i>- It's the perfect weapon, sir.</i>

1230
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,650
All right, Dekkom is trying to change
the map of the world.

1231
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,410
And what? Blame it on a computer glitch?

1232
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,730
Yeah, well, that and a dead president.

1233
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,800
He'll take office after wiping out
everyone in the line of succession.

1234
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,730
Dear God.

1235
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,850
- Get to cover! Under the bridge.
- Sir.

1236
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,290
You are implicating
the Secretary of State in this.

1237
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,770
Do you realize you're committing--

1238
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,770
Treason. Oh, yeah.
I kidnapped the president.

1239
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,290
I've stolen state secrets.
Anything I'm forgetting, honey?

1240
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,090
Honey?

1241
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,650
Guilty.

1242
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,690
It took years
for Dekkom to plan this, sir.

1243
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,650
A president's schedule
always changes last minute.

1244
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,970
This is the one day and date
he could be sure wouldn't move.

1245
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,090
Having my brother and I

1246
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,330
lead the investigation
was a setup from the start.

1247
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,570
Think about it.

1248
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,330
He hired us to fail.

1249
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:00,930
Get down!

1250
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,090
All right, it's saying
we're back in the clear,

1251
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,330
<i>where the four meets the 91!</i>

1252
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,170
Just gotta take care
of a little problem first.

1253
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,620
Hold on!

1254
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,730
No!

1255
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,290
Marry her.

1256
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,290
No. We're fine here.

1257
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,570
<i>A lightning storm in Orlando</i>

1258
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,970
<i>has caused a horrific explosion
at the DNC.</i>

1259
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,770
<i>There is no official word
on the whereabouts of the president...</i>

1260
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,890
I don't know. I don't know.

1261
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,210
I just can't get in touch
with Jake.

1262
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,450
<i>And we have reports now of explosions
on the space station.</i>

1263
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:20,090
Honey, the Orlando storm is getting
really close to your dad's place.

1264
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:23,890
I can't get through to him.
Has he texted you?

1265
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,130
He's not there.

1266
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,050
He's there.

1267
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,250
<i>Of a major issue on the space station.</i>

1268
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,170
<i>Attention all crews.
Now loading final shuttle.</i>

1269
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:51,290
<i>Please board your designated
evacuation shuttles immediately.</i>

1270
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,250
<i>Shuttle launch sequence initiated.</i>

1271
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,090
Jake.

1272
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,410
- I'm not coming.
- What?

1273
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,850
When my brother gets those kill codes,

1274
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,370
someone has to be here
to execute the program.

1275
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,810
No. We need to go.

1276
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,300
We haven't heard from him in hours.

1277
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,610
I trust him.

1278
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,450
You know the reboot
has to be done manually.

1279
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,930
Then I stay. I'm the commander.

1280
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:12,210
No.

1281
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,610
I'm the only one my brother
will trust with the codes,

1282
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,040
so I need your HoloFrame.

1283
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,290
You have to insert it manually
at the core of the mainframe.

1284
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,450
You can find it, yes?

1285
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,290
- Yes.
- Good.

1286
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,290
Goodbye, Ute.

1287
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,050
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> Jake.

1288
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,770
<i>Pull over here.</i>

1289
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,570
The president's beacon shows him
heading right towards us.

1290
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,690
You really wanna drive back into that?

1291
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,170
Yeah, right after it passes,
I'll be the sole survivor,

1292
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,930
ready to be sworn in as
the next President of the United States.

1293
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,540
Here they come.

1294
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,170
Fire.

1295
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,100
You thought the president was the only
one who could be tracked?

1296
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,660
- How in hell did you--
- How?

1297
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,610
Because I'm the goddamn President
of the United States of America.

1298
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,490
You're done, Leonard.

1299
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,650
He's all yours.

1300
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,050
Wait, wait! Wait a minute.

1301
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,410
I've given you an opportunity,
Mr. President.

1302
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,100
You should take it.

1303
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,770
An opportunity? Let him go!

1304
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,970
It's genocide, Leonard!

1305
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,980
You say genocide,
I say preemptive strike.

1306
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,410
You've lost your mind!

1307
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,420
Tomorrow the sun will rise.
All our enemies will be gone.

1308
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,330
Wiped away as if by the hand of God.

1309
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,650
Why would you do this?

1310
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,690
Because no one else would.

1311
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,890
I'm turning the clock back to 1945,

1312
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:57,450
when America was a shining city on a
hill, not a bank disguised as a country.

1313
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:58,970
By playing God?

1314
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,650
What the hell is Dutch Boy
if not playing God?

1315
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,570
Ask Max. He knows.

1316
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,610
Science is all about playing God.

1317
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,130
Sometimes God doesn't play so nice.

1318
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,850
Yeah, well,
you know what my brother would say?

1319
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:11,890
What?

1320
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,210
Get him outta here!

1321
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:23,570
Let's go, Lawson!

1322
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,730
That's my fiancé.

1323
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,690
Get the president to cover! Hurry!

1324
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,970
Mr. President.

1325
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,090
We got the kill codes.

1326
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,250
You'll have to hurry.
The station is in full shutdown.

1327
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,530
What about the crew?

1328
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:40,730
Safe.

1329
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,810
But Jake decided to stay.

1330
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,050
To reboot the satellites.

1331
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,610
Your brother is waiting for you.

1332
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,730
Come on.

1333
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,020
<i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

1334
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,290
Hey.

1335
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,610
<i>Jake.</i>

1336
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,490
<i>Jake, it was Dekkom.</i>

1337
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,410
Well, I did say I might be wrong.

1338
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,210
<i>Mr. President.</i>

1339
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,130
How's Hannah?

1340
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,410

01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,690
How long till the self-destruct?

1346
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,130
Eight minutes,

1351
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,330
You've done your part, Max.

1352
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,810
Jake, what is going on?

1353
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,410
Now it's time for me to do mine.

1354
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,170
No, no, no.

1355
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,850
The kill codes don't stop
the self-destruct, do they?

1356
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,490
Do they?

1357
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:53,690
No,

1358
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,290
only the geostorm.

1359
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:58,090
The station self-destruct
can't be reversed.

1360
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,180
Come on, come on.
There must be a way, huh?

1361
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,210
Come on. It's all my fault.
I'm the one who put you up there!

1362
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,330
Hey, it's okay.

1363
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,250
I wanted to go. It was my choice.

1364
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,970
God knows,

1365
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,970
I haven't always made the right ones.

1366
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,330
You know, you were right,
little brother.

1367
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,210
I was supposed to look after you.

1368
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,130
But you looked after me.

1369
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:35,890
Can you forgive me?

1370
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,320
Yeah, always.

1371
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,170
Look after my little girl.

1372
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,500
Stay in her life.

1373
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,330
I will.

1374
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,330
We should've done this
a long time ago, huh?

1375
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,890
Yeah.

1376
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,000
You're a good man, Jake.

1377
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,650

it is beyond repair or salvation.</i>

01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,970
He's coming back.

1386
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,410
He promised me.

Yeah, well, you were wrong, Jake, again.

01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:55,610
Well, how many times
do I have to tell you?

1439
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,130
Never listen to me.

So when you heading back up?

1445
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,040
- In a week.
- Yeah?

1446
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,140
Yeah, a lot of work left.

1447
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:48,890
But I'll be back.

1448
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,850
I know.

1449
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,810
- This sucks.
- Yeah, seriously, this is so boring.

1450
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,930
You know what?
I can't do this for another second.

1451
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,850
Now, why'd you make us do this
in the first place?

1452
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,850
I don't know.
I was trying to relive a moment.

1453
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,690
A moment? What moment?

1454
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,730
We never went fishing with Dad.
You made that whole story up.

1455
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,570
Yeah, but that was a good story,
though, huh?

1456
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:18,160
I mean, you gotta give me that.

1457
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,050
I mean, it had a moral and everything.

1458
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,050

Wasn't me.

It was your ghost?

00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:55,733
- Hey.
- I looked it up.

52
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,034
It's called a poltergeist.

53
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,434
Dad, tell her.

54
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,737
Well, it's not
very scientific, Murph.

55
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,273
You said science was about
admitting what we don't know.

56
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,746
- She's got you there.
- COOPER: Hey.

57
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,710
Start looking after our stuff.

00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,546
Coop.

59
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,517
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

60
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,596
Don't just tell me that
you're afraid of some ghost.

61
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,255
No, you got to go further.

62
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,700
You got to record
the facts, analyze,

63
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,392
get to the how and the why,

64
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:25,029
then present your conclusions.
Deal?

65
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,097
- Deal.
- All right.

Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

Well, we didn't.

Murphy's Law doesn't mean that
something bad will happen.

00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:13,570
What it means is whatever
can happen will happen.

just fine with us.

Yeah, we had a flat.

So, uh...

177
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:22,318
We got Tom's scores back.

178
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:24,888
He's going to make
an excellent farmer.

179
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:28,224
Yeah, he's got
a knack for it.
What about college?

180
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,694
Well, the university
only takes a handful.

the resources to...

You're a well-educated man,

And a trained pilot.

198
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,097
And an engineer.

199
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,302
Okay, well, right now
we don't need
more engineers.

200
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,838
We didn't run out of
television screens
and planes.

201
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,973
We ran out of food.

Good farmers, like you.

And things are getting better.

will get to be engineers...

Ms. Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.

211
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:39,495
MS. HANLEY: Murph is a great
kid. She's really bright.

212
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,963
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

213
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:43,676
She brought this in
to show the other students.

214
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,268
The section
on the lunar landings.

215
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,204
Yeah, it's one
of my old textbooks.

216
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:50,540
She always loved the pictures.

217
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:51,975
It's an old federal textbook.

218
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:54,210
We've replaced them
with the corrected versions.

219
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:55,978
Corrected?

220
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,747

the Apollo missions
were faked

221
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,416
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

222
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,158
You don't believe
we went to the moon?

223
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,995
I believe it was a brilliant
piece of propaganda.

224
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,397
That the Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources

225
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,900
into rockets
and other useless machines.

226
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,301
"Useless machines."

227
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:20,136
And if we don't want
a repeat of the excess

228
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,806
and wastefulness
of the 20th century, then

229
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,641
we need to teach our kids
about this planet,

230
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:26,143
not tales of leaving it.

231
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,778
You know, one of those
useless machines

232
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,681
they used to make
was called an MRI.

233
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,416
And if we had any of those left,

234
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:34,951
the doctors would've
been able to find

235
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,787
the cyst in my wife's brain

236
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,089
before she died
instead of afterwards.

237
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,333
And then she'd have been
the one sitting here,

238
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:42,192
listening to this instead of me,

239
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:43,536
which would have
been a good thing,

240
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,095
'cause she was always

241
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,197
the calmer one.

242

I'm sorry about your wife,
Mr. Cooper.

243
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,803
But Murph got into a fistfight

244
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,081
with several of
her classmates over this

245
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,039
Apollo nonsense.

246
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:58,117
So we thought it would be best

247
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,543
to bring you in
and see what ideas

248
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,020
you might have for
dealing with her behavior

249
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,078

Yeah, you know what? Um...
There's a game tomorrow night.

252
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,285
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

253
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,364
Her favorite team is playing,
and there's gonna be candy

254
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:13,090
and soda...

255
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:18,028
I think I'll take her to that.

00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,970
I got you suspended.

- BOOTS ON RADIO: Cooper.

This is Cooper, go.

261
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,311
Coop, those combines
you rebuilt went haywire.

262
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:38,115
Uh, just reset the controllers.

263
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,283
I did that.
You should
come take a look.

about which book.

I've been working on it,

00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,796
Why?

00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,012
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

274
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:06,336
I'm trying Morse.

276
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,139
Yeah.

278
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,075
I know what
Morse code is, Murph.

your bookshelf's

281
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,093
COOPER: Had to reset every
compass clock and GPS

282
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:32,028
to offset for the anomaly.

in the sky and wonder

308
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,404
at our place in the stars.

309
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,641
Now we just look down

Cooper,
you were good at something

312
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,383
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

I'm sorry.

314
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:09,058
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food

to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

(PANTING)

406
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:51,447
Who are you?

407
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:53,783
Dr. Brand.

408
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:56,352
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

409
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,454
What makes you think I'm not?

410
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,323
Oh, wasn't near as cute, either.

411
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:02,023
Please, Dr. Brand.

412
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:03,418
I don't have
any idea what this is.

413
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,796
Now I'm scared for
my daughter and
I want her by my side.

414
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,096
You give me that,

415
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,690
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

416
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:13,970
Get the principals

417
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,723
and the girl in
the conference room, please.

418
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:18,241
Your daughter is fine.

419
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:19,876
Bright kid.

420
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:22,712
Must have a very smart mother.

421
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:25,314
It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.

422
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:26,958
So why don't you
just let us back up
from your fence

423
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:29,351
and we'll be on our way? Huh?

424
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:30,619
It's not that simple.

425
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:32,154
Well, sure, it is.

426
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:33,822
I don't know anything about you.

427
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:35,791
I don't know
anything about this place.

428
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,860
Yes, you do.

429
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:44,532
Dad!

430
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:48,402
Hello, Cooper.

431
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:50,906
Professor Brand.

432
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,277
WILLIAMS: Explain to me
how you found this facility.

433
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,111
Kind of an accident.
We stumbled upon it.

434
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:58,981
We were on a salvage run...

435
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:01,784
You're sitting in the
best-kept secret in the world.

436
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:05,621
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

437
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:06,974
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Cooper... Please.

438
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:09,457
Cooperate with these people.

439
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:10,492
Look.

440
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:14,129
It's kind of hard to explain.

441
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:18,000
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

442
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:20,302
What sort of anomaly?

443
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,338
I hesitate to
term it supernatural,

444
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:23,982
(CHUCKLES) but it definitely
wasn't scientific.

445
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,408
You're going to have to be
specific, Mr. Cooper.

446
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:27,743
Right now.

447
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:28,945
It was gravity.

448
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:33,448
DOYLE: Um...

449
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:35,818
What sort of
gravitational anomaly?

450
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,286
- Where was this?
- COOPER: Hey.

451
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,486
Now I'm real happy

452
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,889
'cause you're excited
about gravity, bud,

453
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:42,334
but you're not getting
any answers from us

454
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:43,559
until I get assurances.

455
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:45,094
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

456
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,963
Like that we're
getting out of here.

457
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,636
And I don't mean
in the trunk of some car.

458
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,166
(ALL LAUGHING)

459
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,435
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

460
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:55,971
No, Professor, I don't.

461
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:57,685
BRAND: You know my father,
Professor Brand.

462
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,508
We're NASA.

463
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:02,711
NASA?

464
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:04,045
PROFESSOR BRAND: NASA.

465
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,647
The same NASA you flew for.

466
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,926
COOPER: I heard
they shut you down, sir,

467
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,063
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere

468
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:23,165
onto starving people.

469
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,601
When they realized that
killing other people was

470
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:28,671
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

471
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:29,805
In secret.

472
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,906
Why secret?

473
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,641
Because public opinion
wouldn't allow

474
00:28:32,674 --> 00:28:35,077
spending on space exploration.

475
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,150
Not when you're struggling
to put food on the table.

476
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,349
Blight.

477
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:44,020
Wheat seven years ago.
Okra this year.

478
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,156
Now there's just corn.

479
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,090
And we're growing
more than we ever have.

480
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,226
But like the potatoes in Ireland

481
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,061
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl,

482
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:56,165
the corn will die.

483
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,034
Soon.

484
00:29:03,873 --> 00:29:08,110
We'll find a way, Professor.
We always have.

485
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:11,579
Driven by the unshakeable
faith the Earth is ours.

486
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:14,150
Well, not just ours, no.

487
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:16,185
But it is our home.

488
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:21,190
Earth's atmosphere
is 80% nitrogen.

489
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,991
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

490
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:25,327
Blight does.
And as it thrives,

491
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,597
our air gets
less and less oxygen.

492
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,065
The last people to starve

493
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,233
will be the first to suffocate.

494
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:34,203
And your daughter's generation

495
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:38,373
will be the last
to survive on Earth.

496
00:29:38,406 --> 00:29:40,175
BRAND: Murph is feeling
a little tired.

497
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,289
I was wondering if she could
take a nap in my office.

498
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:43,646
Yeah. Thank you.

499
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,583
Okay.

500
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:50,152
Now you need to tell me

501
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:53,021
what your plan is
to save the world.

502
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:55,123
We're not meant
to save the world.

503
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:56,325
We're meant to leave it.

504
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,799
COOPER: Rangers.

505
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,210
PROFESSOR BRAND:
The last components

506
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:08,870
of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.

507
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,373
Our final expedition.

508
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,110
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

509
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,645
The Lazarus missions.

510
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:17,879
Oh, that sounds cheerful.

511
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:19,982
Lazarus came back from the dead.

512
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,695
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

513
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:24,053
There's not a planet
in our solar system

514
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,520
that could sustain life

515
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:28,223
and the nearest star's
over 1,000 years away.

516
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,493
And that doesn't even
qualify as futile.

517
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,462
Where'd you send 'em?

518
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,897
Cooper,

519
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:38,567
I can't tell you any more
unless you agree

520
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,836
to pilot this craft.

521
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,270
You're the best pilot
we ever had.

522
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:44,272
I barely left the stratosphere.

523
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:46,541
This team never
left the simulator.

524
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,077
We need a pilot,

525
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,679
and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

526
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:51,814
Without even knowing it?

527
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,617
An hour ago, you didn't even
know I was alive.

528
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:57,253
You were going anyway.

529
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,721
We had no choice.

530
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:01,223
But something sent you here.

531
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:02,924
They chose you.

532
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,126
Who's "they"?

533
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,836
How long would I be gone?

534
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,105
Hard to know.

535
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:17,573
Years?

536
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:19,708
I've got kids, Professor.

537
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:22,378
Get out there and save them.

538
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:27,683
Who's "they"?

539
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,985
We started detecting
gravitational anomalies

540
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,920
almost 50 years ago.

541
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:33,888
Mostly small distortions
to our instruments

542
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,557
in the upper atmosphere.

543
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:38,461
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

544
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:41,196
Yeah, over the Straits.

545
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,432
My crash.

546
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:44,800
Something tripped
my fly-by-wire.

547
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,534
Exactly.

548
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,441
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

549
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,475
Out near Saturn,

550
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,679
a disturbance of spacetime.

551
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,682
Is that a wormhole?

552
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,217
It appeared 48 years ago.

553
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,320
And it leads where?

554
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,489
Another galaxy.

555
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,759
A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

556
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:11,861
Someone placed it there.

557
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:14,996
- "They"?
- Mmm-hmm.

558
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,965
And whoever they are,

559
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:19,501
they appear to be
looking out for us.

560
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:22,337
That wormhole
lets us travel
to other stars.

561
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:24,406
It came along
right as we needed it.

562
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,008
They've put potentially
habitable worlds

563
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,541
right within our reach.

564
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,912
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

565
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:31,063
You sent probes into that?

566
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:32,181
Mmm-hmm.

567
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,849
We sent people into it.
Ten years ago.

568
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:38,520
The Lazarus missions.

569
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:40,121
PROFESSOR BRAND:
Twelve possible worlds,

570
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,790
12 Ranger launches carrying

571
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:45,260
the bravest humans ever to live,

572
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:48,163
led by the remarkable
Dr. Mann.

573
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:49,598
Each person's landing pod

574
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:51,533
had enough life support
for two years.

575
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,535
But they could
use hibernation
to stretch that,

576
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,369
making observations on organics

577
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:57,071
over a decade or more.

578
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,307
Their mission was
to assess their world,

579
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,176
and if it showed potential,

580
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:02,778
then they could
send out a signal,

581
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:05,680
bed down for the long nap,
wait to be rescued.

582
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,616
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

583
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:09,585
Hence the bravery.

584
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:12,887
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

585
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:14,388
No.

586
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:18,394
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

587
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,562
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis

588
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:23,499
give us some clue as to
which worlds have potential.

589
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,767
And one system shows promise.

590
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:27,970
One. That's a bit of
a long shot, isn't it?

591
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:32,273
One system with
three potential worlds?

592
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,709
(CHUCKLES)
No long shot.

593
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:36,944
Okay.

594
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:39,982
So if we find a home,

595
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:44,053
then what?

596
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,921
That's the long shot.

597
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,458
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

598
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,060
Did you notice anything strange

599
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,093
about the launch chamber?

600
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:08,410
COOPER: This entire facility's
a centrifuge.

601
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:11,013
Some kind of vehicle.
A space station?

602
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:13,181
PROFESSOR BRAND: Both. Plan A.

603
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,484
How do you get it
off the ground?

604
00:34:15,517 --> 00:34:19,521
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

605
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:24,057
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

606
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:26,628
So I started working on a theory

607
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:29,097
and we started
building this station.

608
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:30,899
But you haven't solved it yet.

609
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:33,569
That's why there's Plan B.

610
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,370
The problem is gravity.

611
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:39,074
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet.

612
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,841
This is one way.

613
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,445
Plan B: a population bomb.

614
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:46,080
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs

615
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:48,283
weighing in at
just under 900 kilos.

616
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:50,886
Well, how would you raise 'em?

617
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,354
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

618
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,390
After that, with surrogacy,

619
00:34:55,423 --> 00:34:56,992
the growth becomes exponential.

620
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,494
Within 30 years,

621
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,363
we could have
a colony of hundreds.

622
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:03,164
The real difficulty
with colonization

623
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:04,466
is genetic diversity.

624
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,536
This takes care of that.

625
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:09,471
But what about
the people here?
You just...

626
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,073
You give up on 'em?

627
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:12,941
My kids?

628
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:16,945
That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.

629
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:20,949
How far have you got?

630
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:22,350
Almost there.

631
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:24,620
You're asking me
to hang everything

632
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:27,556
on an almost.

633
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:29,758
I'm asking you to trust me.

634
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:33,061
(SIGHS)

635
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:34,595
Find us a new home.

636
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,266
And by the time you return,

637
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,568
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

638
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,105
I give you my word.

639
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,119
YOUNG MURPH: Go away!

640
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,628
(SIGHING)

641
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,464
Murph.

642
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:12,368
Go! If you're leaving,
just go.

643
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,940
DONALD: This world was never
enough for you, was it, Coop?

644
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,608
What, because heading out there

645
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,611
is what I feel like
I was born to do?

646
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:25,380
And it excites me?

647
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:28,817
No, that does not make it wrong.

648
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,619
DONALD: It might.

649
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:33,155
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

650
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:36,591
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

651
00:36:36,624 --> 00:36:38,627
And the foundation's solid.

652
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:44,432
We farmers,
we sit here every year

653
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:47,101
when the rains fail and we say,

654
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:48,170
"Next year."

655
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:51,006
Well, next year
ain't gonna save us,

656
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,674
nor the one after that.

657
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,077
This world's a treasure, Donald,

658
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,646
but it's been telling us
to leave for a while now.

659
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,318
Mankind was born on Earth,

660
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,121
it was never meant to die here.

661
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:10,825
Tom will be all right,

662
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:12,728
but you got to
make things right
with Murph.

663
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:13,762
I will.

664
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:17,865
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

665
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:30,546
You have to talk to me, Murph.

666
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,650
I need to fix this before I go.

667
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,086
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

668
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,524
After you kids came along,
your mom,

669
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,827
she said something to me
I never quite understood.

670
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,829
She said, "Now,

671
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,101
"we're just here to be
memories for our kids."

672
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,809
And I think now I understand
what she meant.

673
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,912
Once you're a parent,

674
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:08,217
you're the ghost
of your children's future.

675
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,854
(SNIFFLES) You said
ghosts didn't exist.

676
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:20,028
That's right, Murph.

677
00:38:23,398 --> 00:38:24,666
Murph, look at me.

678
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:30,038
I can't be your ghost right now.

679
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:33,942
I need to exist.

680
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,579
They chose me.

681
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:39,947
Murph, they chose me.

682
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:42,117
You saw. You're the one
who led me to 'em.

683
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:47,222
That's exactly why you can't go.

684
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:53,161
I figured out the message.

685
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:55,597
One word. Know what it is?

686
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,766
"Stay."

687
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,568
It says, "Stay," Dad.

688
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,736
(WHISPERS) Murph.

689
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:03,704
You don't believe me.

690
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:06,674
Look at the books!
Look at this. It says, "Stay."

691
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,311
Why... You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

692
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:11,879
No, I'm coming back.

693
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:13,081
When?

694
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:17,920

Or traveling
near the speed of light,

or near a black hole,

700
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,145
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

701
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,682
When we get back,

702
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:49,617
we're gonna compare.

703
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,062
YOUNG MURPH: Time will
run differently for us?

704
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:52,086
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

705
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:54,555
By the time I get back,

706
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:57,726
we might even be
the same age, you and me.

707
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:00,329
"What?" Imagine that!

00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:06,635
Aw, Murph...

when you're coming back.

so he'd fit in better
with his unit.

00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:13,955
That's 100%.

766
00:43:13,988 --> 00:43:16,390
Let's bring it on down
to 75, please.

767
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:17,959
TARS: Stage two separation.

768
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:31,239
COOPER:
All feeds going manual.

769
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:32,340
DOYLE: Going manual.

770
00:43:35,076 --> 00:43:36,653
Deactivate probe heater
one, two and three.

771
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:37,845
DOYLE: Check.

772
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,053
Taking control.

773
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:46,421
TARS: This is handover to you.

774
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:51,793
DOYLE: ADF check.

775
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:53,428
COOPER: Over.

776
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:57,131
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one,
two, three.

777
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:58,500
DOYLE: 100%.

778
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,601
COOPER: Ex-mites.

779
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:11,112
It's hard leaving everything.

780
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:15,016
My kids. Your father.

781
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:17,352
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

782
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:18,786
We should learn to talk.

783
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,155
And when not to.

784
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,359
Just being honest.

785
00:44:24,392 --> 00:44:27,062
I don't think
you need to be that honest.

786
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:29,130
Hey, TARS, what's
your honesty parameter?

787
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:30,664
90%.

788
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:32,400
90%?

789
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:35,637
Absolute honesty isn't
always the most diplomatic,

790
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,972
nor the safest form
of communication
with emotional beings.

791
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:39,507
Okay.

792
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:42,577
90% it is, Dr. Brand.

793
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:48,316
We are coming up
on the Endurance.

794
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:49,517
Twelve minutes out.

795
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:08,670
Okay. Taking control.

796
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:15,176
Approaching module port,
500 meters.

797
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:29,224
It's all you, Doyle.

798
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:50,245
Nice and easy, Doyle.
Nice and easy.

799
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:56,951
I'm feeling good.

800
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:58,119
Take us home.

801
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,128
Lock?

802
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:08,729
- Target locked.
- DOYLE: Target locked.

803
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:10,464
- COOPER: Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

804
00:46:10,497 --> 00:46:11,497
Good job.

805
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:46,734
Door's not charging.

806
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:48,236
Never mind.

807
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:12,627
Cooper, you should have control.

808
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:14,496
Control here.

809
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,533
Communication with
ring module active.

810
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:26,541
(WHISPERS) Oh, wow.

811
00:47:32,613 --> 00:47:33,613
TARS: That's initiate.

812
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:41,255
(BRAND SIGHS)

813
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:42,524
COOPER: Are we ready to spin?

814
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:43,557
BRAND: Just a sec.

815
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:56,470
TARS: Hello, CASE.

816
00:47:56,504 --> 00:47:57,504
Hello, TARS.

817
00:47:58,406 --> 00:48:00,275
All right, we're all set.

818
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,243
Let's do it.

819
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:22,230
(CHUCKLES)

820
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:32,640
COOPER: 30% of spin.

821
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:40,748
One G.

822
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:43,618
How's gravity
treating you back there?

823
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:45,253
Well.

824
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:50,591
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

825
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,126
- Yeah.
- You all right?

826
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,529
Mmm. Yeah,
I just need a minute.

827
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:56,173
BRAND: Okay, I think
we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod.

828
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:57,731
I'm just gonna go get that.

829
00:48:57,765 --> 00:48:58,942
Might be in
the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

830
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:00,067
Hey, Brand?

831
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:01,669
Yeah?

832
00:49:01,703 --> 00:49:02,770
- Bring a lot.
- (LAUGHS)

833
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:15,149
Amelia... Be safe.

834
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,817
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.

835
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:18,719
I will, Dad.

836
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:21,088
It looks good
for your trajectory.

837
00:49:21,122 --> 00:49:23,925
We've calculated
two years to Saturn.

838
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:26,327
That's a lot of Dramamine.

839
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:30,298
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

840
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:33,467
We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

841
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,870
A little older, a little wiser,

842
00:49:35,903 --> 00:49:37,205
but happy to see you.

843
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:44,245
"Do not go gentle

- ROMILLY: Yeah.

851
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:31,659
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

852
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:36,531
Here. Pills.

853
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,402
So alone.

854
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:43,571
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

855
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:44,805
No, I mean them.

856
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:46,240
Hmm?

857
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:47,641
COOPER: It's a perfect planet,

858
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:50,378
and we're not gonna
find another one like her.

859
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:53,248
No, it's not like
looking for a new condo.

860
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:56,551
The human race is going to be

861
00:50:56,951 --> 00:50:58,552
adrift,

862
00:50:58,586 --> 00:51:00,354
desperate for a rock
it can cling to

863
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:01,722
while it catches its breath.

864
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:04,758
We need to find that rock.

865
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:07,461
And our three prospects
are at the edge of what

866
00:51:07,494 --> 00:51:10,097
might sustain human life.

867
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,599
Laura Miller's planet is first.

868
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:13,968
Laura started
our biology program.

869
00:51:14,002 --> 00:51:15,002
COOPER: Mmm-hmm.

870
00:51:19,974 --> 00:51:21,408
BRAND: Uh,
Wolf Edmunds is here.

871
00:51:21,442 --> 00:51:22,677
Tell me about Edmunds.

872
00:51:23,878 --> 00:51:26,347
Oh, uh...
Wolf's a particle physicist.

873
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,852
None of them had families, huh?

874
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:35,189
No. No attachments.
My father insisted.

875
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:37,057
They all knew the odds against

876
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,892
ever seeing
another human being again.

877
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:40,894
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

878
00:51:40,928 --> 00:51:41,963
How about Mann?

879
00:51:41,964 --> 00:51:42,997
Dr. Mann?

880
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,232
Well, he's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

881
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:47,601
He inspired 11 people
to follow him

882
00:51:47,635 --> 00:51:49,737
on the loneliest journey
in human history.

883
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,305
Scientists, explorers.

884
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,374
That's what I love.

885
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:55,410
You know, out there
we face great odds.

886
00:51:55,943 --> 00:51:57,078
Death, but...

887
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:00,715
Not evil.

888
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,050
You don't think
nature can be evil?

889
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:05,453
No. Formidable.
Frightening. But...

890
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,689
No, not evil.

891
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,461
Well, is a lion evil because
it rips a gazelle to shreds?

892
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:15,095
Just what we take
with us, is that it?

893
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,830
Yeah.

894
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:19,400
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

895
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:21,168
Even me, huh?

896
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:23,137
You know what?
We agreed, 90%.

897
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,170
There you go.

898
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:26,006
Don't stay up.

899
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,241
I'll be there in a minute.

900
00:52:27,274 --> 00:52:29,277
Just remember, Coop,

901
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,045
you are literally
wasting your breath.

902
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:39,519
COOPER: Hey, TARS?

903
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:41,455
Let's go over that trajectory
one more time.

904
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:43,657
TARS: Eight months to Mars.

905
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,726
Counter-orbital
slingshot around.

906
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,295
Fourteen months to Saturn.
Nothing's changed on that.

907
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:49,997
Just let me ask you something.

908
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:53,910
(WHISPERING)
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

909
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:55,894
TARS: Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.

910
00:52:57,605 --> 00:52:59,106
(NORMAL VOICE)
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.

911
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,508
They close?

912
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,176
I wouldn't know.

913
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:05,345
Is that 90% "wouldn't know"
or 10% "wouldn't know"?

914
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:07,081
I also have
a discretion setting, Cooper.

915
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:08,383
Oh.

916
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:11,886
But not a poker face, Slick.

917
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:25,566
Hey, guys.

918
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:29,603
Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

919
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:32,272
So I wanted to
give you an update.

920
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:34,275
Uh...

921
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:36,644
The Earth looks
amazing from here.

922
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:38,345
Um...

923
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:40,114
You can't see any of the dust.

924
00:53:40,147 --> 00:53:41,449
(CHUCKLES)

925
00:53:42,716 --> 00:53:45,786
I really hope
you guys are doing great.

926
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:47,259
I know you're gonna
get this message.

927
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,791
Professor Brand's assured me
that he's gonna get it to you.

928
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,193
Know that I love you.

929
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,329
Is it him?

930
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,602
DONALD:
I don't think so, Murph.

931
00:54:03,203 --> 00:54:04,705
You must be Donald.

932
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:08,007
Hello, Murph.

933
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,812
Why are you in my dad's truck?

934
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:13,648
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

935
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,584
He sent you a message.

936
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,055
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

937
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:23,724
If you record any messages,

938
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:25,860
I can get them
to transmit it to Cooper.

939
00:54:27,194 --> 00:54:29,697
Murph is a bright spark.

940
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:33,700
Maybe I should fan the flame.

941
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:36,570
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

942
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:38,973
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

943
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,509
So where are they?

944
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:42,844
Heading for Mars.

945
00:54:43,811 --> 00:54:45,746
The next time
you hear from Cooper,

946
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:47,715
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

947
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:29,123
YOUNG TOM: school goes,

948
00:55:29,156 --> 00:55:31,491
the administration wants me
to repeat plant pathology.

949
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:32,660
Which sucks.

950
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:34,795
But they said I could start

951
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:36,197
advanced agriculture
a year early.

952
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:42,036
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

953
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,542
DONALD: I'm sorry, Coop.

954
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:50,110
I asked Murph to say hi,

955
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:53,313
but she's as stubborn
as her old man.

956
00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:54,916
I'll try again next time.

957
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:11,332
COOPER: You all right, Rom?

958
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:15,936
This gets to me, Cooper.

959
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,238
This. This.

960
00:56:18,272 --> 00:56:21,374
Millimeters of aluminum,
that's it, and then nothing

961
00:56:21,408 --> 00:56:23,276
out there for millions of miles

962
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,046
won't kill us in seconds.

963
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,316
You know that some of the finest

964
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:32,385
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

965
00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:33,754
They don't know how.

966
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:35,308
And if they go overboard,
they're done.

967
00:56:37,491 --> 00:56:39,160
We're explorers, Rom.

968
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:42,597
This is our boat.

969
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:43,931

COOPER: This is
from the relay probe?

974
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:14,929
It was in orbit
around the wormhole.

975
00:57:15,496 --> 00:57:16,664
This is the wormhole,

976
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:18,199
and every time we'd come around,

977
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:20,500
we would receive images

978
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:22,570
from the other side
of the foreign galaxy.

979
00:57:22,603 --> 00:57:24,505
Oh, yeah. Like swinging
a periscope around.

980
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:25,906
Exactly.

981
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,773
So we got a pretty good idea

982
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,144
what we're gonna find
on the other side, huh?

983
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:32,713

approaching the wormhole
in about three hours.

986
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:45,357
Hey, Coop?

987
00:57:46,393 --> 00:57:48,228
Can we stop the spinning?

988
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:49,662
- Why?
- Um...

989
00:57:49,696 --> 00:57:51,732
Because we're close enough
to see it now?

990
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:54,267
All right.

991
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:56,069
(WHISPERS) Thanks.

992
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:04,278
There, that's it!
That's the wormhole!

993
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:05,446
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

994
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:07,848
It's a sphere.

995
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:11,284
Of course it is. You thought
it would just be a hole?

996
00:58:12,753 --> 00:58:14,821
No, it's just that
all the illustrations

997
00:58:14,854 --> 00:58:16,390
I've ever seen, they...

998
00:58:16,423 --> 00:58:17,791
ROMILLY: The illustrations

999
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:20,193
are trying to show you
how it works.

1000
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:24,396
So they say you want to
go from here to there.

1001
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:25,566
But it's too far, right?

1002
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,100
Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:29,570
So a wormhole
bends space like this,

1004
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:31,738
so you can take
a shortcut through

1005
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:33,674
a higher dimension.

1006
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:35,742
Okay, so,

1007
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:37,144
to show that, they've turned

1008
00:58:37,177 --> 00:58:39,979
three-dimensional space
into two dimensions,

1009
00:58:40,013 --> 00:58:43,851
which turns a wormhole into
two dimensions... A circle.

1010
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:45,920
What's a circle
in three dimensions?

1011
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:48,789
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

1012
00:58:49,323 --> 00:58:51,592
A spherical hole.

1013
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:54,028
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

1014
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:56,695
I'm not thanking anybody

1015
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,100
until we get out of here

1016
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:07,807

We're here.

1043
01:02:07,053 --> 01:02:08,821

came through.

BRAND: How?

1045
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,225
The relay on this side
cached them.

No real surprises.

pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

1050
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:26,039
Maybe. He was sending
the thumbs up

right until it went dark.

01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:29,709
But Miller's still looks good,
though, right?

1053
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:30,786
Because she's coming up fast.

1054
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,011
Mmm-hmm.

1055
01:02:32,045 --> 01:02:34,715

1056
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:37,650

01:02:39,052 --> 01:02:40,563
It's what we're calling
the black hole.

1059
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:42,956
Miller's and Dr. Mann's
planets both orbit it.

1060
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,925
And Miller's is on the horizon?

around a hoop.

1062

Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

1063
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:51,498
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

1064
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:55,935
Look, I could swing around

1065
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:57,537
that neutron star to decelerate.

1066
01:02:57,571 --> 01:02:59,573
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's time.

1067
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:01,642
The gravity on that planet
will slow our clock

drop down there without...

1075

Cooper, we have a mission.

1076
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:23,973
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,

1077
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:25,565
and our mission Plan A is

1078
01:03:25,598 --> 01:03:27,400
to find a planet that
can habitate the people

1079
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:29,035
that are living
on the Earth right now.

1080
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:30,446
You can't just think
about your family.

1081
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,881
Now, you have to think
bigger than that, all right?

1082
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:33,307
I am thinking about my family

1083
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,175
and millions of
other families, okay?

1084
01:03:35,209 --> 01:03:37,343
Plan A does not work
if the people on Earth

1085
01:03:37,377 --> 01:03:39,046
are dead by the time
we pull it off.

1086
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,782
No. It doesn't.

1087
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:44,051
That's why there's a Plan B.

1088
01:03:46,086 --> 01:03:48,054
Okay. Cooper's right.

1089
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:49,632
We need to think about time
as a resource,

1090
01:03:49,656 --> 01:03:50,891
just like oxygen and food.

1091
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:52,244
Going down there
is gonna cost us.

1092
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:55,195
All right, look.

1093
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,698
Dr. Mann's data
is promising, right,

1094
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:00,476
but it's going to take us
months to get there.

1095
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,703
And Edmunds', it's even further.

1096
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:03,904
Now Miller hasn't sent much,

1097
01:04:03,937 --> 01:04:05,247
but what she has sent
is very promising.

1098
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:06,906
It's water, it's organics...

1099
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:07,984
You don't find that every day.

1100
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:09,576
No, you don't.

1101
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,079
And just think
about the resources,
including time,

1102
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:14,181
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

1103
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,083
- Romilly?
- Yeah.

1104
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:19,285
How far off from Miller's
planet do we have to be

1105
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:21,555
to stay out of the time shift?

1106
01:04:21,588 --> 01:04:22,823
Just back from the cusp.

1107
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,858
Which is here,

1108
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:26,102
just outside of Miller's planet.

1109
01:04:26,126 --> 01:04:27,694
- ROMILLY: Right.
- Okay.

1110
01:04:29,129 --> 01:04:32,232
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

1111
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:33,933
Instead of taking the Endurance

1112
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:35,210
into orbit
around Miller's planet,

1113
01:04:35,234 --> 01:04:36,736
which would conserve fuel,

1114
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,471
but we would lose a lot of time,

1115
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,407
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

1116
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:42,909
parallel with Miller's planet,

1117
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:45,278
outside of this time shift,
to here?

1118
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,780

01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,408
Well, not far enough!

1296
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:43,909
And now we're stuck here

1297
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:45,863
till there won't be anyone
left on Earth to save.

1298
01:14:49,048 --> 01:14:51,184
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

1299
01:14:56,422 --> 01:14:57,891
Is there any possibility...

1300
01:14:58,357 --> 01:14:59,859
I don't know...

1301
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:02,161
Some kind of way we can maybe
all jump in a black hole?

1302
01:15:02,194 --> 01:15:03,263
Gain back the years?

1303
01:15:03,296 --> 01:15:04,564
(SCOFFS)

1304
01:15:04,597 --> 01:15:06,399
Don't shake your head at me.

1305
01:15:06,432 --> 01:15:08,435
Time is relative, okay?

1306
01:15:08,468 --> 01:15:11,071
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but

1307
01:15:11,971 --> 01:15:14,406
it can't run backwards.
It just can't.

1308
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,476
The only thing that can move
across dimensions, like time,

1309
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:18,510
is gravity.

1310
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:22,182
Okay.

1311
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:28,721
The beings that led us here,
they communicate

1312
01:15:28,754 --> 01:15:29,822
through gravity, right?

1313
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:30,890
(WHISPERS) Yes.

1314
01:15:30,923 --> 01:15:32,643
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

1315
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:34,759
Maybe.

1316
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:35,795
Okay. If they can...

1317
01:15:37,196 --> 01:15:40,900
"They" are beings
of five dimensions.

1318
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:43,903
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

1319
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:45,937
To them,

1320
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:47,906
the past might be a canyon

1321
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,576
that they can climb into
and the future,

1322
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:53,246
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

1323
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,916
Look, Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

1324
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:01,053
But you knew about relativity.

1325
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:02,087
Oh...

1326
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,125
Brand...

1327

(INHALES DEEPLY)

1328
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:12,965
My daughter was 10 years old.

1329
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:14,209
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories

1330
01:16:14,233 --> 01:16:16,235
before I left.

1331
01:16:16,269 --> 01:16:18,629
Couldn't you have told her you
were going to save the world?

1332
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:20,238
No.

1333
01:16:21,974 --> 01:16:24,410
When you become a parent,

1334
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:25,684
one thing becomes really clear.

1335
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:29,024
And that is that
you want to make sure

1336
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:30,283
your children feel safe.

1337
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:34,020
And it rules out
telling a 10-year-old

1338
01:16:34,053 --> 01:16:35,488
that the world is ending.

1339
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:38,723

we don't have it.

Hello, Rom.

1351
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,452
I've waited years.

1352
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:42,355

How many years?

1356
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:03,977

There's nothing here for us.

1360
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:16,923
(SOFTLY)
Why didn't you sleep?

1361
01:18:17,957 --> 01:18:20,493
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.

1362
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:22,662
But I stopped believing
you were coming back.

1363
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:26,131
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1364
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:29,835
I learned what I could
from the black hole,

1365
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:32,271
but I couldn't send anything
to your father.

1366
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:34,573

Checking in. Saying hi.

I wanted to call him Coop,

1396

but Lois says, uh,
maybe next time.

1397

earned the "great" part,

1398

come back.

I never made one of these
when you were still responding

because I was so mad at you
for leaving.

it seemed like I should
live with that decision.

I needed to get out.

they're still out there.

There are so many reasons
their communications

1455
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,120
might not be getting through.

I'm not sure
what I'm more afraid of.

Them never coming back,

1459
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:36,240
or coming back
to find we've failed.

1460
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:37,476

01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:06,539
before I kick the bucket.

1471
01:24:06,572 --> 01:24:08,073
Don't be morbid, Professor.

1472
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:09,275
I'm not afraid of death.

1473
01:24:10,142 --> 01:24:11,744
I'm an old physicist.

1474
01:24:13,145 --> 01:24:14,680
I'm afraid of time.

1475
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:23,021
MURPH: Time.

1476
01:24:25,224 --> 01:24:26,726
You're afraid of time.

1477
01:24:29,662 --> 01:24:31,663
For years, we've been
trying to solve the equation

1478
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:32,874
without changing
the underlying assumption

1479
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:34,400
about time.

1480
01:24:34,433 --> 01:24:36,401
- And?
- And that means

1481
01:24:36,435 --> 01:24:41,140
Each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

1482
01:24:41,173 --> 01:24:43,275
It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.

1483
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:45,277
Are you calling my life's work

1484
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:47,346
nonsense, Murph?

1485
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:49,214
No, I'm saying
you've been trying to

1486
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:50,481
finish it with one arm...

1487
01:24:50,515 --> 01:24:52,884
No, with both arms
tied behind your back.

1488
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,056
And I don't understand why.

1489
01:24:58,257 --> 01:24:59,892
I'm an old man, Murph.

1490
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:03,962
Can we take this point up
at another time?

1491
01:25:03,995 --> 01:25:05,765
I want to talk to my daughter.

1492
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:11,003
PROFESSOR BRAND: Stepping out
into the universe,

1493
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:14,407
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

1494
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:20,546
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

1495
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:25,051
We must think not as
individuals but as a species.

1496
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:31,424
"Do not go gentle
into that good night."

1497
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:34,493
COOPER: TARS
kept the Endurance

1498
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:35,894
right where we needed her.

1499
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:38,997
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

1500
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:42,067
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

1501
01:25:42,735 --> 01:25:43,936
We have to choose.

1502
01:25:45,237 --> 01:25:46,372
But how?

1503
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:48,974
They're both promising.

1504
01:25:50,642 --> 01:25:52,545
Edmunds' data is better,

1505
01:25:52,578 --> 01:25:55,481
but Dr. Mann is the one
still transmitting.

1506
01:25:55,514 --> 01:25:56,648
We've no reason to suspect

1507
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:58,084
Edmunds' data would have soured.

1508
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:02,020
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1509
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:03,455
As does Dr. Mann's.

1510
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:04,990
Cooper, this is my field.

1511
01:26:06,225 --> 01:26:07,225
And...

1512
01:26:08,527 --> 01:26:10,496
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1513
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:11,864
Why?

1514
01:26:11,897 --> 01:26:13,132
Gargantua, that's why.

1515
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,204
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes.

1516
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:22,406
But no life. Sterile.

1517
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,840
We'll find the same thing
on Mann's.

1518
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:26,044
Because of the black hole?

1519
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:27,212
BRAND: Murphy's Law.

1520
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:29,515
Whatever can happen will happen.

1521
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:31,816
Accident is the first
building block of evolution.

1522
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,161
But when you're orbiting
a black hole,

1523
01:26:33,185 --> 01:26:34,753
not enough can happen.

1524
01:26:34,786 --> 01:26:37,389
It sucks in asteroids
and comets,

1525
01:26:37,422 --> 01:26:39,458
other events which would
otherwise reach you.

1526
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:41,026
We need to go further afield.

1527
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:43,963
You once said that Dr. Mann

1528
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:47,199
was the best of us.

1529
01:26:47,232 --> 01:26:49,068
He's remarkable.

1530
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:50,341
We're only here because of him.

1531
01:26:51,036 --> 01:26:53,004
And yet here he is.

1532
01:26:53,038 --> 01:26:54,640
He's on the ground,

1533
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:57,209
and he's sending a very
unambiguous message,

1534
01:26:57,242 --> 01:27:00,045
telling us to
come to his planet.

1535
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:04,483
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

1536
01:27:05,084 --> 01:27:06,184
We should vote.

1537
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:07,419
Well, if we're going to vote,

1538
01:27:07,453 --> 01:27:08,773
there's something
you should know.

1539
01:27:09,388 --> 01:27:10,923
Brand?

1540
01:27:10,956 --> 01:27:12,091
He has a right to know.

1541
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:14,493
That has nothing to do with it.

1542
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:16,195
What does?

1543
01:27:16,228 --> 01:27:18,063
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1544
01:27:18,097 --> 01:27:19,164
ROMILLY: Is that true?

1545
01:27:19,197 --> 01:27:20,466
Yes.

1546
01:27:23,902 --> 01:27:26,205
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

1547
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:31,676
But maybe we've spent too long

1548
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,545
trying to figure all this out
with theory.

1549
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:35,213
You're a scientist, Brand.

1550
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:36,582
So listen to me

1551
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:41,219
when I say that love isn't
something we invented.

1552
01:27:41,253 --> 01:27:43,255
It's (SIGHS)

1553
01:27:43,289 --> 01:27:45,491
observable, powerful.

1554
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:49,628
It has to mean something.

1555
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:52,163
Love has meaning, yes.
Social utility,

1556
01:27:52,197 --> 01:27:54,033
social bonding, child rearing...

1557
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:56,168
We love people who have died.

1558
01:27:56,202 --> 01:27:57,562
Where's the social utility
in that?

1559
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,704
None.

1560
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:03,307
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't

1561
01:28:03,342 --> 01:28:05,744
yet understand.

1562
01:28:05,778 --> 01:28:08,848
Maybe it's some evidence,
some...

1563
01:28:10,315 --> 01:28:12,551
artifact of a higher dimension

1564
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:14,786
that we can't
consciously perceive.

1565
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:17,289
I'm drawn across the universe

1566
01:28:17,322 --> 01:28:19,624
to someone I haven't seen
in a decade,

1567
01:28:19,658 --> 01:28:22,928
who I know is probably dead.

1568
01:28:22,962 --> 01:28:26,498
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving

1569
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:28,934
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1570
01:28:31,236 --> 01:28:32,671
Maybe we should trust that,

1571
01:28:32,704 --> 01:28:34,607
even if we can't
understand it yet.

1572
01:28:40,378 --> 01:28:41,747
All right, Cooper...

1573
01:28:43,915 --> 01:28:44,950
Yes,

1574
01:28:46,818 --> 01:28:49,522
the tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

1575
01:28:50,589 --> 01:28:51,957
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

01:28:52,991 --> 01:28:54,760
Honestly, Amelia,

1577
01:28:56,895 --> 01:28:57,895
it might.

the water is alkali,

ammonia in it to breathe

for more than
just a few minutes,

1708

the first organics we found

as ammonia crystals.

I decommissioned him

1728

his whole life to Plan A.

solved his equation

Then why wouldn't he use it?

1767
01:42:26,737 --> 01:42:28,740
The equation couldn't
reconcile relativity

01:42:28,773 --> 01:42:30,875
with quantum mechanics.

1771
01:42:34,345 --> 01:42:36,247
You need to see
into a black hole.

1772
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:38,349
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1773

Romilly, is that true?

1774
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:42,787
If a black hole is an oyster,

1775
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:45,189
then the singularity's
the pearl inside.

1776
01:42:45,222 --> 01:42:47,925
The gravity's so strong,
it's always hidden
in darkness

1777

behind the horizon.

1778
01:42:50,895 --> 01:42:53,129
That's why we call it
a black hole.

Bullshit.

1794
01:43:20,958 --> 01:43:22,469
You never would've come here
unless you believed

1795
01:43:22,493 --> 01:43:23,994
you were gonna save them.

1796
01:43:24,028 --> 01:43:26,230
Evolution has yet
to transcend
that simple barrier.

1797
01:43:26,263 --> 01:43:29,100
We can care deeply, selflessly

1798
01:43:29,133 --> 01:43:30,534
about those we know,

1799
01:43:30,567 --> 01:43:32,103
but that empathy rarely extends

1800
01:43:32,136 --> 01:43:33,303
beyond our line of sight.

1801
01:43:33,337 --> 01:43:34,906
But the lie.

1802
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,478
That monstrous lie?

1803
01:43:41,846 --> 01:43:42,846
Unforgivable.

1804
01:43:43,347 --> 01:43:45,716
And he knew that.

1805
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,752
He was prepared to
destroy his own humanity

1806
01:43:47,785 --> 01:43:50,120
in order to save the species.

1807
01:43:50,154 --> 01:43:51,298
He made an incredible sacrifice.

1808
01:43:51,322 --> 01:43:52,424
No.

1809
01:43:53,992 --> 01:43:56,427
No, an incredible sacrifice
is being made

1810
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,696
by the people on Earth
who are gonna die!

1811
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:02,132
Because in his arrogance

1812
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:03,802
he declared their case hopeless.

1813
01:44:04,568 --> 01:44:05,937
I'm sorry, Cooper,

1814
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:07,972

No. No.

1816
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,110
We are the future.

1817
01:44:16,247 --> 01:44:17,949
Cooper, what can I do?

1818
01:44:21,252 --> 01:44:23,687
Let me go home.

1819
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:26,490
GETTY: You're
absolutely positive?

1820
01:44:26,524 --> 01:44:28,593
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

1821
01:44:29,327 --> 01:44:30,662
It's worthless?

1822
01:44:30,695 --> 01:44:31,830
It's half the answer.

1823
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:35,834
Okay. How do you find
the other half?

1824
01:44:36,634 --> 01:44:38,469
Out there? A black hole.

1825
01:44:38,502 --> 01:44:39,870

I'm not sure you can.

1828
01:44:46,443 --> 01:44:48,746

they just pack up and leave.

1829
01:44:50,447 --> 01:44:52,150
What are they hoping to find?

1830
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:53,916
Survival.

1831
01:45:01,759 --> 01:45:02,759
Damn it.

1832
01:45:05,697 --> 01:45:07,031

Well, panic won't help.

1836

We just have to keep working,
same as ever.

1837
01:45:14,572 --> 01:45:16,574
Yeah. But isn't that exactly

1838
01:45:16,607 --> 01:45:17,984
what Professor Brand was
manipulating us to do?

1839
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:19,376
Brand gave up on us.

1840
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:21,012
I'm still trying to solve this.

1841
01:45:21,813 --> 01:45:22,813
So...

1842
01:45:24,348 --> 01:45:25,850
Do you have an idea?

1843
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:27,886
A feeling.

1844
01:45:31,488 --> 01:45:33,156
I told you about my ghost.

1845
01:45:35,593 --> 01:45:37,795
My dad thought
I called it a ghost

1846
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:39,297
because I was scared of it.

1847
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,360
But I was never scared of it.

1848
01:45:46,804 --> 01:45:49,073
I called it a ghost
because it felt...

1849
01:45:51,676 --> 01:45:53,177
It felt like a person.

1850
01:45:56,013 --> 01:45:57,373
It was trying to
tell me something.

1851
01:46:00,818 --> 01:46:03,321
If there's an answer
here on Earth, it's back there

1852
01:46:04,155 --> 01:46:05,790
somehow, in that room.

1853
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:08,059
So I have to find it.

1854

1858
01:46:18,903 --> 01:46:20,080

most of the way, anyway.

1859

- Yeah.

1860
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:24,008
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1861
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:25,375
Yeah, what's that?

1862
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:26,889
Have one last crack
at the black hole.

1863
01:46:28,446 --> 01:46:30,281
I'm going home, Rom.

1864
01:46:30,314 --> 01:46:33,183
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to
cost you any time.

1865
01:46:34,452 --> 01:46:36,052
There's a chance
for the people on Earth.

1866
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,721
Talk to me.

1867
01:46:37,755 --> 01:46:39,923
Gargantua's an older
spinning black hole.

1868
01:46:39,957 --> 01:46:42,293
It's what we call
a gentle singularity.

1869
01:46:42,593 --> 01:46:43,861
Gentle?

1870
01:46:43,894 --> 01:46:45,530
They're hardly gentle.

1871
01:46:45,563 --> 01:46:47,665
But the tidal gravity
is so quick that

1872
01:46:47,698 --> 01:46:50,468
something crossing the horizon
fast might survive.

1873
01:46:50,501 --> 01:46:52,270
A probe, say.

1874
01:46:52,303 --> 01:46:53,704
What happens after it crosses?

1875
01:46:53,737 --> 01:46:57,174
After the horizon
is a complete mystery.

1876
01:46:57,208 --> 01:47:00,277
So, what's to say there
isn't some way that the probe

1877
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:03,314
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1878
01:47:03,347 --> 01:47:04,648
If he's equipped to transmit

1879
01:47:04,682 --> 01:47:06,851
every form of energy
that can pulse.

1880
01:47:06,884 --> 01:47:09,120
TARS: Just when did this probe
become a "he," Professor?

1881
01:47:09,954 --> 01:47:11,623
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1882
01:47:12,757 --> 01:47:14,924
I've already told him
what to look for.

1883
01:47:14,959 --> 01:47:17,495
TARS: I need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.

1884
01:47:17,528 --> 01:47:18,963
You'd do this for us?

1885
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:20,331

you get all teary,

TARS: I'm not joking.

1890
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:31,575
I'm gonna need TARS
to remove and adapt

1891
01:47:31,608 --> 01:47:33,310
some components from KIPP.

1892
01:47:33,343 --> 01:47:35,646
Well, I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1894

All right.

1895
01:47:38,916 --> 01:47:41,519
Dr. Mann, we need to find
three secure sites.

1896
01:47:41,552 --> 01:47:43,988
One for Brand's lab,
two for habitat.

1897
01:47:44,021 --> 01:47:46,199
Once those modules
have landed, you don't
want to move 'em.

1898
01:47:46,223 --> 01:47:47,534
Well, I can take you
to the probe sites,

1899
01:47:47,558 --> 01:47:48,892
but I don't think this...

1900
01:47:48,926 --> 01:47:50,361
These conditions are gonna hold.

1901
01:47:50,394 --> 01:47:51,828
I think we should wait.

1902

headed back down

with the rest
of the distillery equipment.

1904
01:47:55,032 --> 01:47:57,335
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1905
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,340
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1906
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,509
Okay then.

1907
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:06,653
- But you're gonna need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

1908
01:48:06,677 --> 01:48:08,012

- Yeah.

you feel you have to go back.

at least mention that

I'm honored to be
a part of this.

1923

my work's done here.

promise you that, that yearning

1928

people is powerful.

2492

But they didn't choose me,
they chose her.

02:29:58,086 --> 02:29:59,138

2498
02:29:59,139 --> 02:30:00,189
(LAUGHS)

2499
02:30:02,057 --> 02:30:03,559

It's infinitely complex.

2503
02:30:14,402 --> 02:30:16,638
They have access
to infinite time and space,

2504
02:30:16,672 --> 02:30:19,241
but they're not
bound by anything!

2505
02:30:19,274 --> 02:30:22,444
They can't find
a specific place in time.

2506
02:30:22,477 --> 02:30:23,745
They can't communicate.

2507
02:30:25,614 --> 02:30:28,316
That's why I'm here. I'm gonna
find a way to tell Murph,

2508
02:30:28,349 --> 02:30:30,085
just like I found this moment.

2509
02:30:30,118 --> 02:30:31,185
TARS: How, Cooper?

2510
02:30:31,219 --> 02:30:32,754
Love, TARS, love.

2511
02:30:32,787 --> 02:30:35,089
It's just like Brand said.
My connection with Murph,

2512
02:30:35,123 --> 02:30:37,292
it is quantifiable.
It's the key!

2513
02:30:37,325 --> 02:30:38,927
TARS: What are we here to do?

2514
02:30:39,995 --> 02:30:40,996
Find how to tell her.

2515
02:30:44,665 --> 02:30:45,767
The watch.

2516
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:50,405
The watch.

2517
02:30:51,673 --> 02:30:52,808
That's it.

2518
02:30:55,677 --> 02:30:58,347
We code the data into the
movement of the second hand.

2519
02:31:02,350 --> 02:31:05,487

into Morse and feed it to me.

2521
02:31:07,389 --> 02:31:09,658

never came back for it?

2522
02:31:11,259 --> 02:31:13,795
She will. She will.

2527
02:31:29,177 --> 02:31:30,746

It was him all this time!
I didn't know. It was him!

2538

Eureka!

2540
02:33:11,312 --> 02:33:12,646
It's traditional.

2541

(LAUGHING) Eureka!

2542
02:33:23,425 --> 02:33:25,460
Did it work?

2543
02:33:25,493 --> 02:33:27,028
TARS: I think it might have.

2544
02:33:28,363 --> 02:33:29,964
How do you know?

2545
02:33:29,998 --> 02:33:33,034
TARS: Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

2546
02:33:37,238 --> 02:33:39,040
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

2547
02:33:40,275 --> 02:33:41,877
They're not "beings."

2548
02:33:42,844 --> 02:33:43,979
They're us.

2549
02:33:46,615 --> 02:33:49,518

Murph, they're doing for me.

2550

people couldn't build this.

2552
02:33:54,088 --> 02:33:56,323
COOPER: No. No, not yet.

2553
02:33:56,357 --> 02:33:57,592
But one day.

2554
02:33:58,793 --> 02:34:01,630
Not you and me. But a people.

2555
02:34:03,064 --> 02:34:04,732

2556
02:34:04,766 --> 02:34:06,935

we know.

Let's take it slow, sir.

2561
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,716
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

2562
02:35:27,749 --> 02:35:29,650
Remember, you're
no spring chicken anymore.

2563
02:35:29,684 --> 02:35:31,887
Actually, you are 124 years old.

2565
02:35:39,527 --> 02:35:40,929
Take it slow, sir.

2566
02:35:42,129 --> 02:35:44,699
You were extremely lucky.

2567
02:35:44,732 --> 02:35:46,277
The Rangers found you
with only minutes left

2568
02:35:46,301 --> 02:35:47,836
in your oxygen supply.

DOCTOR: Cooper Station.

2573
02:36:08,222 --> 02:36:09,324
Currently orbiting Saturn.

2574
02:36:11,493 --> 02:36:13,228
Cooper Station.

2575
02:36:16,331 --> 02:36:18,165
Nice of you to name it after me.

02:36:18,199 --> 02:36:19,200
(LAUGHS)

2577
02:36:21,903 --> 02:36:23,437
What?

2578
02:36:23,471 --> 02:36:24,815
The station
isn't named after you, sir.

2579
02:36:24,839 --> 02:36:26,841
It's named after your daughter.

2580
02:36:26,875 --> 02:36:28,643
Although she's always maintained

2581
02:36:28,676 --> 02:36:30,144
just how important you were.

2582
02:36:30,177 --> 02:36:31,680
Is she still alive?

2583
02:36:33,547 --> 02:36:34,827
She'll be here
in a couple weeks.

2584
02:36:36,551 --> 02:36:37,885
She is far too old

2585
02:36:37,918 --> 02:36:39,162
to be transferring
from another station,

2586
02:36:39,186 --> 02:36:41,690
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

2587
02:36:42,691 --> 02:36:43,891
Well, this is...

2588
02:36:43,924 --> 02:36:45,564
This is Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

2589
02:36:46,394 --> 02:36:47,696
Yes, it is.

2590
02:36:50,465 --> 02:36:52,968
DOCTOR: We'll have you checked
out of here in a couple days.

2591
02:36:55,303 --> 02:36:57,638
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

2592
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:03,444
I actually did a paper on you
in high school.

2593
02:37:03,477 --> 02:37:05,614
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

2594
02:37:07,281 --> 02:37:08,283
Oh, yeah.

2595
02:37:08,583 --> 02:37:09,818
Right.

2596
02:37:12,753 --> 02:37:14,055
If you'll follow me,

2597
02:37:14,088 --> 02:37:16,958
we've got a really
good situation for you.

2598
02:37:21,162 --> 02:37:24,398
So, um, when I made
my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

2599
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,403
I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect.

2600
02:37:32,073 --> 02:37:33,317
OLD WOMAN 1:
It was just constant.

2601
02:37:33,341 --> 02:37:35,877
Just that steady blow of dirt.

2602
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:38,780
Of course, I didn't
speak to her personally.

2603
02:37:38,813 --> 02:37:40,815
We always
set the plate upside-down.

2604
02:37:40,848 --> 02:37:44,050
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

2605
02:37:44,085 --> 02:37:48,956
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else
back then.

2606
02:37:48,989 --> 02:37:51,826
There just wasn't enough food.

2607
02:37:51,859 --> 02:37:54,428
OLD WOMAN 2: We wore
little things, little strips

2608
02:37:54,462 --> 02:37:58,666
of sheet, put it sometimes
over our nose and mouth,

2609
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:00,010
so we wouldn't
breathe so much of it.

2610
02:38:00,034 --> 02:38:03,271
Well, it was pretty exciting
for me because it was hope.

2611
02:38:03,304 --> 02:38:05,206
OLD MAN: I don't care
who describes it,

2612
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:07,742
there is no way for it to be
exaggerated. It was that bad.

2613
02:38:07,775 --> 02:38:09,510
ADMINISTRATOR:
She did confirm

2614
02:38:09,544 --> 02:38:11,679
just how much you loved farming.

2615
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:13,414
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah.

2616
02:38:13,448 --> 02:38:15,216
Here we are.

2617
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:16,950
Home sweet home.

2618
02:38:16,984 --> 02:38:19,854
Everything replaced
and put back where it...

2619
02:38:26,461 --> 02:38:27,528
Hey, is this...

2620
02:38:27,561 --> 02:38:29,130
Oh, yeah.

2621
02:38:29,163 --> 02:38:31,966
The machine we found
out near Saturn
when we found you, yes.

2622
02:38:31,999 --> 02:38:33,701
Its power source was shot,

2623
02:38:33,735 --> 02:38:35,045
but we could get you
another one if you want it.

2624
02:38:35,069 --> 02:38:36,471
Yes. Please.

02:39:13,474 --> 02:39:14,908
You want 55?

2639
02:39:20,181 --> 02:39:22,350
TARS: Is this really
what it was like?

2640
02:39:24,719 --> 02:39:26,988
It was never this clean,
Slick. (CHUCKLES)

2641
02:39:31,426 --> 02:39:33,260
I don't care much for this

2642
02:39:33,294 --> 02:39:34,929
pretending we're back
where we started.

2643
02:39:37,365 --> 02:39:39,200
I want to know where we are.

2644
02:39:41,236 --> 02:39:42,403
Where we're going.

2645
02:39:47,208 --> 02:39:49,511
Mr. Cooper.
The family's all in there.

2646
02:39:50,444 --> 02:39:51,779
Family?

2647
02:39:51,813 --> 02:39:53,246
Yeah, they all came out
to see her.

2648
02:39:53,281 --> 02:39:55,283
She's been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years.

It was me, Murph.

2653
02:40:40,661 --> 02:40:42,197
I was your ghost.

2654
02:40:43,631 --> 02:40:44,966
I know.

2655
02:40:47,135 --> 02:40:48,903
People didn't believe me.

2656
02:40:48,936 --> 02:40:51,406
They thought that
I was doing it all myself.

2657
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:53,074
But...

2658
02:40:55,810 --> 02:40:57,345
I knew who it was.

2659
02:41:02,783 --> 02:41:04,352
Nobody believed me.

2660
02:41:05,619 --> 02:41:07,388
But I knew you'd come back.

2661
02:41:10,224 --> 02:41:11,226
How?

2662
02:41:13,694 --> 02:41:16,231
Because my dad promised me.

2663
02:41:22,770 --> 02:41:24,505
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

2664
02:41:25,806 --> 02:41:27,108
I'm here.

2665
02:41:28,709 --> 02:41:29,911
No.

2666
02:41:32,546 --> 02:41:35,916
No parent should have to
watch their own child die.

2667
02:41:39,287 --> 02:41:41,322
I have my kids here for me now.

2668
02:41:44,525 --> 02:41:45,660
You go.

2669
02:41:49,363 --> 02:41:50,398
Where?

02:41:54,368 --> 02:41:55,536
Brand.

2671
02:42:05,146 --> 02:42:06,948
She's out there,

02:42:58,533 --> 02:43:02,737
Maybe right now she's
settling in for the long nap

02:43:21,289 --> 02:43:23,624

2677

<i>I am the one...</i>

31
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,503
<i>...who runs from both
the living and the dead.</i>

32
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,923
<i>Hunted by scavengers.</i>

33
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,468
<i>Haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

34
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,355
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

35
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:15,406
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct:</i>

36
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:17,574
<i>Survive.</i>

37
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:38,864
Max?

38
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:39,990
Is that you?

39
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:41,992
Where were you?

40
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,079
Help us. Where were you?

41
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,122
Where were you, Max?

42
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,098
Where were you, Max?

43
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:06,350
Stop running.

44
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:08,519
You let us die!

45
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,438
You let us die!

46
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:12,898
You let us die!

47
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:14,691
You promised to help us!

48
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:15,734
Why?

49
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,171
Witness!

50
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,591
I got him.

51
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:30,809
We are War Boys!

52
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:31,977
War Boys!

53
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,062
Kamakrazee War Boys!

54
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,105
War Boys!

55
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:37,482
Fucacima kamakrazee...

56
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,026
...War Boys!

57
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:41,236
Hooked on!

58
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:42,905
Today we're heading...

59
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:44,489
...to Gas Town!

60
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,074
Gas Town!

61
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,327
Today we're hauling Aqua Cola.

62
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,370
Aqua Cola!

63
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:53,415
- Today we're hauling produce!
- Produce!

64
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,083
And today we're hauling...

65
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,543
...Mother's Milk!

66
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,295
Mother's Milk!

67
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,490
<i>Joe! Joe! Joe! Immortan Joe!</i>

68
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,388
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

69
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:02,651
Once again, we send off my War Rig
to bring back...

70
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,237
...guzzoline from Gas Town...

71
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,240
...and bullets from the Bullet Farm!

72
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:12,452
Once again, I salute my Imperator...

73
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:14,329
...Furiosa!

74
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,497
And I salute...

75
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,375
...my half-life War Boys...

76
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,961
...who will ride with me eternal...

77
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,588
...on the highways of Valhalla.

78
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,216
<i>V8! V8! V8! V8!</i>

79
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:29,094
I am your redeemer.

80
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,680
It is by my hand...

81
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,975
...you will rise from the ashes...

82
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,184
...of this world!

83
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:46,820
It's coming. Get ready.

84
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,033
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's coming.

85
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,716
Do not, my friends...

86
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,094
...become addicted to water.

87
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:53,929
It will take hold of you...

88
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:57,140
...and you will resent its absence.

89
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,500
Clear off!

90
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,087
Get them all off!

91
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,630
Clear off!

92
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,674
Get them all off.

93
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,760
Get off!

94
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:41,184
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

95
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,378
I got a War Boy...

96
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,380
...running on empty.

97
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,674
Hook up that full-life.

98
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,930
Hey! Careful. That's a universal donor.

99
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,531
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

100
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,452
Bullet Farm?

101
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,498
We're heading east.

102
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,252
I'll pass it down the line.

103
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,379
New orders!

104
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,297
Thunder up! Thunder up!

105
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,007
This is not a supply run!

106
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:37,968
Go. Go.

107
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,762
- Ace, what's going on?
- Go. We're heading east.

108
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,390
- Why?
- I don't know. That's the order.

109
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:02,033
Moo.

110
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:03,326
- Hey, Pa.
- Hmm?

111
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,120
You know about this?

112
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,540
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

113
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,010
She's gone off-road...

114
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,304
...into hostile territory.

115
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,557
Why would she do that?

116
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:28,476
Let me see.

117
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:29,436
Rictus.

118
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,146
- I wanna see.
- Rictus.

119
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,648
Go see what's agitating Dad.

120
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,219
Splendid!

121
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,097
Angharad!

122
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:16,566
Where are they?

123
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,651
They are not your property.

124
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:19,694
Miss Giddy?

125
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,696
You cannot own a human being.

126
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,158
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

127
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,494
Where is she taking them?

128
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:29,954
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

129
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,500
Where is she taking them?

130
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,543
A long way from you.

131
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,029
Hey. Hey, what's happening?

132
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,324
Slit!

133
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,493
What's going on? Slit!

134
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:11,454
Treason. Betrayal.
An Imperator gone rogue.

135
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:12,372
An Imperator.

136
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:13,206
Who?

137
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:16,292
Furiosa! She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

138
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,377
What stuff?

139
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,754
Breeders! His prize breeders!

140
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,507
He wants them back!
Not a hand laid on them.

141
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:31,391
By my deeds I honor him.

142
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,725
V8.

143
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,314
<i>V8! V8! V8!</i>

144
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:45,488
That's my wheel.

145
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:46,531
I'm driving.

146
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,740
You're my lancer.

147
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,367
I just promoted myself.

148
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,161
Not today. Today is my day.

149
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,203
Look at you.

150
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,289
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war.

151
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,790
He's right, son.

152
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,209
I'm not staying here dying soft.

153
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,961
You're already a corpse.

154
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,380
- I just need a top-up. More juice.
- No time!

155
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,174
We take my Blood Bag.

156
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:06,634
We take my Blood Bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

157
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,428
It's got a muzzle on it. It's feral.

158
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:09,262
That's right.

159
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,723
High-octane crazy blood
filling me up.

160
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,687
If I'm gonna die...

161
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,107
...I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road.

162
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:29,532
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:33,036
- Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.
- Eh?

164
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,496
Right-o.

165
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,174
How much more can they take from me?

166
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,635
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

167
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:27,715
Immortan!

168
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,593
Immortan Joe!

169
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:34,931
He looked at me!

170
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:38,434
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your Blood Bag!

171
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,979
He turned his head.
He looked me in the eye.

172
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,398
He was scanning the horizon.

173
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:44,899
No.

174
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,317
I am awaited.

175
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,945
I am awaited in Valhalla!

176
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,533
<i>Confucamus!</i>

177
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:56,995
Immortan!

178
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,872
Yeah!

179
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,019
Hey! Heads up!

180
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,228
Heads up!

181
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,109
Boss!

182
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,069
We got vehicles from the Citadel.

183
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,613
They're firing flares.

184
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:33,364
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town...

185
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,199
...and the Bullet Farm.

186
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,200
What is this?

187
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,785
Backup? Decoy?

188
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:40,705
It's a detour.

189
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:13,863
Eyes right!

190
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,284
Buzzards!

191
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,454
- Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!
- Buzzards right!

192
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:22,789
- Eyes on!
- Eyes on!

193
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,628
Should we turn it around
and run them into our backup?

194
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,839
No! We're good!

195
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,050
We fang it!

196
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,514
Thunder up! Here we go!

197
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,435
Prepare the gunners!

198
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:14,382
Morsov!

199
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,011
Come on, attack!

200
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:32,608
War!

201
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,702
Ready!

202
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,372
She's ours, Slit!

203
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:29,248
She's ours.

204
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,918
First, we get the Buzzards off her back!

205
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:38,633
Form up!

206
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,180
That's my head!

207
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,551
Get up! You can do it!

208
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:27,807
Morsov!

209
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,352
- Morsov!
- No!

210
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,312
- Witness me!
- Witness!

211
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:34,397
Witness!

212
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,731
Aah!

213
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,070
Fly!

214
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:46,367
Witness!

215
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,326
Witness!

216
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,997
Mediocre, Morsov!

217
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,457
- Mediocre!
- Hoorah!

218
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,606
Aah!

219
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:24,947
Get ready!

220
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:27,867
Back me in!

221
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:33,247
They're coming!

222
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,975
We can't breathe down there!

223
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,101
Stay out of sight!

224
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:55,811
Now!

225
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,441
Aah!

226
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,492
Go back!

227
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,410
Where's he going?

228
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,244
Hydraulics!

229
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:13,454
Hydraulics!

230
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,167
Aah!

231
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:36,811
Yeah.

232
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:44,151
Now we bring home the booty.

233
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,680
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

234
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,765
She thinks we're stupid.

235
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,393
She thinks she can lose us in there!

236
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:37,038
Fang it!

237
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,040
Fang it!

238
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,130
Why can't you stop?

239
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,133
Crew! Out of the way!

240
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,092
Out of the way!

241
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,552
What have you done?

242
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,928
What have you done?

243
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:57,391
Yeah.

244
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,994
We need counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag down the back.

245
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,508
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

246
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,326
Hey, head!

247
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,744
Say bye-bye to the neck!

248
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:00,871
We're going in!

249
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,353
Come on! We've almost got her!

250
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,488
Come on! Hold it steady!

251
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:45,309
Oh, what a day!

252
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,311
What a lovely day!

253
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:07,539
I am the man...

254
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,125
...who grabs the sun...

255
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,672
...riding to Valhalla!

256
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,133
Witness me...

257
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:19,176
...Blood Bag!

258
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,848
Witness!

259
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,000
I live, I die, I live again!

260
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,590
Aah!

261
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,474
We're not going back.

262
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:04,962
Water.

263
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:58,640
Ah.

264
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:01,810
You.

265
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,703
Angharad, is that just the wind...

266
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,122
...or is that a furious vexation?

267
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,686
Ugh!

268
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,046
I got it!

269
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:04,683
Aah!

270
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:37,424
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

271
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,010
He's gonna shred her. Shred her.

272
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,595
Bolt cutters.

273
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,263
Chain.

274
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,099
Hey, hey!

275
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,396
Oh, look at them.

276
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,232
So shiny. So chrome.

277
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,942
He's gonna be so grateful.

278
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,403
We could ask for anything.

279
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,239
I wanna drive the War Rig.

280
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,451
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

281
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,411
Heh, heh. Sure.

282
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:10,248
- You can ask for more than a jacket.
- We're going to the Green Place.

283
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,209
Wait, it's you and me. Ugh!

284
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,308
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

285
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,453
How does it feel?

286
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,872
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

287
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,502
You wanna get through this?

288
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,215
Do as I say.

289
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,472
Now pick up what you can and run.

290
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:15,272
Tsa!

291
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,474
Kill switches.

292
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,644
I set the sequence myself.

293
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,813
This Rig goes nowhere without me.

294
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,943
You can get in.

295
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,738
Not without them.

296
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,331
So we wait.

297
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,675
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

298
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,887
You've damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

299
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,189
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

300
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,525
I'd say you got
about a five-minute head start.

301
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,327
You want that thing off your face?

302
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,216
Let's go.

303
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,148
Ah, uh-uh.

304
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,264
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

305
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:15,952
Smeg!

306
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:37,974
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

307
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:40,518
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

308
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,686
- Why?
- To bargain.

309
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:42,937
Oh, he'll hurt us.

310
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,939
Think he's coming to the Green Place?

311
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,232
Never! He's a crazy smeg...

312
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,109
...who eats schlanger!

313
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:15,929
Nah, stay out of there.

314
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:17,263
Behind you.

315
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,015
Huh?

316
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,561
The Gas Town Boys.

317
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,190
Don't damage the goods.

318
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,115
What do you see?

319
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,868
Big Rigs...

320
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:41,955
...Polecats...

321
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:43,748
...Flamers...

322
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,169
...and there's the People Eater himself.

323
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,297
Coming to count the cost.

324
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,507
Hmm.

325
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,478
Aah!

326
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,566
We're dragging something out back.

327
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,151
I think it's the fuel pod.

328
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:12,861
No, no.

329
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,113
I'll go.

330
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:40,823
- Filth! You traitored him!
- Ah!

331
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,913
No unnecessary killing!

332
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,957
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

333
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:51,501
He's kamakrazee!

334
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,962
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life!

335
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:56,256
No! I live. I die. I live again!

336
00:45:57,006 --> 00:45:58,549
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

337
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,676
Throw him out!

338
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:01,261
Chuck him out!

339
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,055
You got more friends.

340
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,809
Bullet Farmer.

341
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,228
- They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
- Yeah?

342
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,147
It's over. You can't defy him.

343
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:14,399
Just watch us, mate!

344
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:15,441
He is the one...

345
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,819
- ...who grabbed the sun.
- Look how slick he's fooled you.

346
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,612
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand...

347
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,698
- ...we'll be lifted up!
- That's why we have...

348
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,491
...his logo seared on our backs!

349
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,368
"Breeding Stock!" "Battle Fodder!"

350
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:26,536
No, I am awaited!

351
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:29,080
- You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!
- Killing everyone...

352
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,707
- ...and everything.
- We're not to blame!

353
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:32,792
Then who killed the world?

354
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:02,905
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

355
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,491
I don't know if it's still any good.

356
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,368
Get back in the hold!

357
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:09,162
Keep the hatch open.

358
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:17,420
I need you here.

359
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:21,299
You may have to drive the Rig.

360
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:24,093
Mm.

361
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:27,472
You.

362
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,932
You stay.

363
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:32,226
You stay there.

364
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:38,191
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

365
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,234
I'm supposed to be alone.

366
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,986
That was the deal.

367
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:49,786
Down here.

368
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:11,516
Hey.

369
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,810
What's your name?

370
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:16,687
What do I call you?

371
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:19,273
Does it matter?

372
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:22,735
Fine.

373
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,362
When I yell "fool"...

374
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:26,906
...you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

375
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:30,034
This is the sequence:

376
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:32,495
One. One, two.

377
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:33,788
One.

378
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:36,874
Red. Black. Go.

379
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,793
You have it?

380
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:05,755
It's all here!

381
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:09,967
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

382
00:50:14,013 --> 00:50:15,723
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

383
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,227
You drop the rocks.

384
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,153
You said:

385
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:30,863
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

386
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:32,573
Maybe."

387
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:34,033
We count three War Parties!

388
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:37,787
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

389
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:39,747
Let's do this!

390
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:07,400
Fool!

391
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,775
That's our fuel!

392
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,500
Make way for the Ripsaw!

393
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:11,964
Come on! Move them!

394
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:22,808
Once I'm over...

395
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:25,269
...clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

396
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,479
Immortan!

397
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:28,773
Immortan Joe!

398
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:32,276
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig.

399
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:36,572
You! Climb aboard!

400
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:40,076
Hey. Hey!

401
00:52:41,077 --> 00:52:42,286
I got his boot!

402
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:44,538
I got the Blood Bag's boot!

403
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:46,457
Take me!

404
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:48,292
I got his boot!

405
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:52,922
All this for a family squabble.

406
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,591
Healthy babies.

407
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:51,874
Aah!

408
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:04,845
Reload the clip.

409
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:06,222
I can't.

410
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:14,104
Gun!

411
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,607
Gimme the gun!

412
00:55:16,857 --> 00:55:17,441
Not loaded yet!

413
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:18,317
Now!

414
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:19,151
We had a deal!

415
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,321
Ugh!

416
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:09,618
Rictus!

417
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:11,120
The wives!

418
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,705
No more flames.

419
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:20,713
Splendid!

420
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:22,339
Splendid!

421
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,465
That's my child!

422
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:26,093
My property!

423
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:29,013
Immorta...

424
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:42,610
Immortan. If I get on the Rig,
there's a way inside.

425
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,820
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

426
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:47,489
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing.

427
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,699
No.

428
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:50,576
Put a bullet in her skull.

429
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:53,537
Stop the Rig,
return my treasures to me...

430
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:56,206
...and I, myself, will carry you...

431
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:57,917
...to the Gates...

432
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,418
...of Valhalla.

433
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:01,170
Am I awaited?

434
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:03,464
You will ride eternal...

435
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:06,008
...shiny and chrome.

436
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:08,719
Rictus!

437
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,055
Help him aboard!

438
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:13,807
Ready?

439
00:57:14,475 --> 00:57:15,684
Here we go!

440
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:25,486
Aah!

441
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:28,238
Mediocre!

442
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:00,104
Schlanger!

443
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,543
Look out!

444
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:25,546
Angharad!

445
00:58:26,547 --> 00:58:27,256
Get out!

446
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:49,820
No!

447
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:50,988
Angharad!

448
00:59:05,836 --> 00:59:08,088
Stop! Turn the Rig around!

449
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:10,507
Go back for her!

450
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:12,760
No.

451
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,511
Tell him to turn the Rig around!

452
00:59:14,762 --> 00:59:15,804
Did you see it?

453
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,265
She went under the wheels.

454
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:19,892
Did you see it?

455
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,270
She went under the wheels.

456
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,647
We keep moving.

457
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:26,940
- No!
- We keep moving!

458
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:29,818
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

459
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:32,071
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

460
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:34,698
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it!

461
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:49,797
- You all right?
- On! On!

462
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:29,044
Cheedo!

463
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:30,963
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

464
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:31,964
Stop!

465
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:33,757
He'll forgive us. I know he will.

466
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:35,175
There is no going back!

467
01:00:35,425 --> 01:00:37,094
- We were his treasures!
- Cheedo!

468
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:40,222
We were protected! He gave us the high life!

469
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:43,225
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

470
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:44,226
No!

471
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:46,645
We are not things!

472
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:48,147
We are not things.

473
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:51,316
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

474
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:52,734
And now she's dead!

475
01:00:54,153 --> 01:00:55,279
Wring your hands and tear your hair...

476
01:00:55,529 --> 01:00:56,989
...but you're not going back.

477
01:00:57,447 --> 01:00:59,241
You're not going back to him.

478
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:00,409
Angharad!

479
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:02,536
Come on! Come on!

480
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,264
So, um, ahem...

481
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:24,141
...where is this...

482
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,227
...Green Place?

483
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,480
It's a long night's run, heading east.

484
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,109
We need inventory.

485
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:35,736
Match every gun with its bullets.

486
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:42,409
I'm gonna go and do some repairs.

487
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:44,077
We need someone down the back.

488
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:45,078
I'll go.

489
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:46,038
No.

490
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:48,040
I want you to stay together.

491
01:01:48,624 --> 01:01:49,875
I can do it.

492
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:24,201
What are you doing here?

493
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,870
He saw it.

494
01:02:27,454 --> 01:02:28,872
He saw it all.

495
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,793
My own Blood Bag driving the Rig
that killed her.

496
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,760
Stop doing that.

497
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:45,097
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

498
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:46,431
Stop.

499
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:59,361
Three times the gates were open to me.

500
01:02:59,653 --> 01:03:00,654
What gates?

501
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,156
I was awaited in Valhalla.

502
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,992
They were calling my name.

503
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:09,538
I should be walking with the Immorta.
McFeasting with the heroes of all time.

504
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:15,961
I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to.

505
01:03:17,796 --> 01:03:20,465
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

506
01:03:20,716 --> 01:03:24,177
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

507
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:28,140
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

508
01:03:28,515 --> 01:03:30,183
Who are Larry and Barry?

509
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:32,311
My mates.

510
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:34,146
Larry and Barry.

511
01:03:36,189 --> 01:03:38,775
If they don't get me,
then the Night Fevers will.

512
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,095
Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here,
so he's all but useless.

513
01:04:08,555 --> 01:04:09,639
But...

514
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:13,894
...we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

515
01:04:16,313 --> 01:04:18,440
Angharad used to call them Antiseed.

516
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:21,610
Plant one and watch something die.

517
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,438
Hold on, mate.

518
01:05:56,872 --> 01:06:00,000
We are down
30,000 units of guzzoline...

519
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,128
...19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes...

520
01:06:04,212 --> 01:06:04,880
...seven pursuit vehicles.

521
01:06:05,881 --> 01:06:07,007
The deficit mounts.

522
01:06:07,257 --> 01:06:08,341
And now, sir...

523
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,553
...you have us stuck in a quagmire.

524
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,263
Hey, Joe!

525
01:06:14,181 --> 01:06:15,265
Boss!

526
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:19,519
Your girly's breathing her last!

527
01:06:20,145 --> 01:06:22,063
What about the child?

528
01:06:31,281 --> 01:06:32,782
Are you coming, brother?

529
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:34,117
Wait!

530
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:36,953
It's gone awful quiet in there.

531
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:38,371
Get it out.

532
01:06:38,622 --> 01:06:39,873
Get it out!

533
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,836
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

534
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:46,588
Patience!

535
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:50,884
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy.

536
01:06:51,134 --> 01:06:54,304
- I'll fetch them for you.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

537
01:06:56,932 --> 01:06:59,184
Just one angry shot...

538
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:01,478
...for Furiosa.

539
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:02,687
Hut!

540
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:03,897
Yeah!

541
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:12,656
Crying shame. Heh.

542
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:14,032
Come.

543
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:16,034
Another month...

544
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:18,828
...could have been your viable human!

545
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:20,413
Was it a male?

546
01:07:20,664 --> 01:07:22,249
Your A-1 Alpha prime.

547
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,753
Hey, Rictus!

548
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:29,798
You lost a baby brother!

549
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:34,010
Perfect in every way.

550
01:07:36,805 --> 01:07:38,348
I had a baby brother!

551
01:07:38,765 --> 01:07:40,725
I had a little baby brother!

552
01:07:40,976 --> 01:07:42,769
And he was perfect!

553
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:44,896
Perfect in every way!

554
01:08:15,635 --> 01:08:16,761
Come on.

555
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:27,856
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.

556
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:29,190
Just probing.

557
01:08:40,535 --> 01:08:42,120
He wants to help!

558
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,163
Who?

559
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:44,748
The War Boy!

560
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:46,416
Where did he come from?

561
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:48,001
I thought we threw him off the Rig!

562
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:53,506
There's high ground...

563
01:08:53,757 --> 01:08:55,634
- ...just beyond that thing.
- He means the tree.

564
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:57,552
Yeah. Tree!

565
01:08:59,054 --> 01:08:59,804
Leave him to me.

566
01:09:00,055 --> 01:09:03,558
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?

567
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:04,934
Get out.

568
01:09:05,185 --> 01:09:06,311
I can do this. I know this machine.

569
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:08,146
He does. He's a Revhead.

570
01:09:13,735 --> 01:09:14,736
You've got two left!

571
01:09:21,117 --> 01:09:22,243
On him.

572
01:09:39,886 --> 01:09:41,471
Don't breathe.

573
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:43,723
Ugh!

574
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:46,017
Hey!

575
01:09:46,267 --> 01:09:47,602
Hey! Hey!

576
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:48,853
War Boy!

577
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:51,690
I'm gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!

578
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:53,775
Take this.

579
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:55,735
Let's get the engine plates.

580
01:09:56,986 --> 01:09:57,946
You drive the Rig!

581
01:09:58,196 --> 01:10:00,031
- Hold up a flare!
- I am holding a flare!

582
01:10:00,824 --> 01:10:03,201
- Closer!
- It's right in front of your eyes!

583
01:10:04,244 --> 01:10:05,203
Aah!

584
01:10:15,547 --> 01:10:17,257
Hut! Hut!

585
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:24,848
Blood Bag!

586
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:33,690
I am the scales of justice!

587
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:36,526
Conductor of the choir of death!

588
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,404
Sing, Brother Heckler.

589
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:42,657
Sing, Brother Koch!

590
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:49,164
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

591
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,332
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

592
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:07,557
Gun fever!

593
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:20,129
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

594
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:22,131
How are the engines?

595
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:24,217
Very hot and real thirsty.

596
01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:33,101
Hey. You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track.

597
01:12:34,269 --> 01:12:37,188
What if you're not back by the time
the engines have cooled?

598
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:40,942
Well, you keep moving.

599
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:52,412
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

600
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:55,039
Retaliate first.

601
01:12:58,418 --> 01:12:59,627
Let's go!

602
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:22,001
- Are you hurt?
- Huh?

603
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:23,461
You're bleeding.

604
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:25,672
That's not his blood.

605
01:14:27,465 --> 01:14:28,841
What is this?

606
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,927
It's Mother's Milk.

607
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:14,470
It's okay.

608
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:15,763
Sleep.

609
01:15:16,973 --> 01:15:18,474
Get some rest.

610
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:31,529
How do you know this place even exists?

611
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:35,700
I was born there.

612
01:15:37,994 --> 01:15:39,078
So why'd you leave?

613
01:15:39,495 --> 01:15:40,663
I didn't.

614
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:44,167
I was taken as a child.

615
01:15:45,918 --> 01:15:47,045
Stolen.

616
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:54,802
You done this before?

617
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:56,846
Many times.

618
01:15:57,847 --> 01:16:00,141
Now that I drive a War Rig...

619
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:03,895
...this is the best shot I'll ever have.

620
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:06,147
And them?

621
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:09,692
They're looking for hope.

622
01:16:10,735 --> 01:16:12,111
What about you?

623
01:16:17,575 --> 01:16:18,868
Redemption.

624
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:04,747
Hey, what's that?

625
01:17:17,343 --> 01:17:19,470
I remember something like that.

626
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:33,276
Help me!

627
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:37,947
Help me!

628
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,743
- Help me, please!
- Uh, uh.

629
01:17:42,994 --> 01:17:44,245
Please!

630
01:17:44,954 --> 01:17:46,080
That's bait.

631
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:48,916
Stay in the Rig.

632
01:17:54,172 --> 01:17:57,049
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

633
01:17:58,467 --> 01:17:59,302
I am one of...

634
01:17:59,552 --> 01:18:00,803
...the Vuvalini!

635
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:03,556
Of the Many Mothers!

636
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:08,352
My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon!

637
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,190
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

638
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:16,235
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

639
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:04,742
It's me.

640
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,543
There's something in the eyes.

641
01:19:15,086 --> 01:19:17,171
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

642
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,177
This is our Furiosa.

643
01:19:26,722 --> 01:19:28,099
How long has it been?

644
01:19:29,725 --> 01:19:31,102
Seven thousand days.

645
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,813
Plus the ones I don't remember.

646
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:36,274
Furiosa.

647
01:19:37,692 --> 01:19:39,360
What happened to your mother?

648
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,154
She died.

649
01:19:42,989 --> 01:19:44,657
On the third day.

650
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:52,915
From where did you come?

651
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:57,003
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

652
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:01,924
The men.

653
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:03,342
Who are they?

654
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,927
They're reliable.

655
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:07,013
They helped us get here.

656
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:21,110
Where did you find such creatures?

657
01:20:23,696 --> 01:20:24,989
So soft.

658
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:27,116
This one has all her teeth!

659
01:20:32,663 --> 01:20:33,789
Oh.

660
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,336
I can't wait for them to see it.

661
01:20:38,961 --> 01:20:40,087
See?

662
01:20:41,255 --> 01:20:42,506
See what?

663
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:44,008
Home.

664
01:20:48,012 --> 01:20:49,513
The Green Place.

665
01:20:49,764 --> 01:20:51,891
But if you came from the West...

666
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,477
...you passed it.

667
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:57,271
The crows.

668
01:20:57,563 --> 01:21:00,066
The creepy place with all the crows.

669
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,485
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

670
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,528
- We had no water.
- The water was filth.

671
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:06,405
It was poisoned. It was sour.

672
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:08,032
And then the crows came.

673
01:21:08,282 --> 01:21:10,034
We couldn't grow anything.

674
01:21:10,284 --> 01:21:11,619
Where are the others?

675
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:12,828
What others?

676
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:14,246
The Many Mothers.

677
01:21:14,497 --> 01:21:15,998
We're the only ones left.

678
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:18,060
Look.

679
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:23,023
That's what you call a satellite.

680
01:22:23,774 --> 01:22:26,026
Miss Giddy told us about those.

681
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,447
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

682
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,782
Shows.

683
01:22:32,032 --> 01:22:34,326
Everyone in the old world
had a show.

684
01:22:36,662 --> 01:22:37,496
Do you think there's still...

685
01:22:37,746 --> 01:22:39,039
...somebody out there?

686
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:41,792
Sending shows?

687
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:43,419
Who knows?

688
01:22:44,545 --> 01:22:46,797
Those are the Plains of Silence.

689
01:22:49,425 --> 01:22:51,469
Stay right where you are, little Joe.

690
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:53,846
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

691
01:22:54,096 --> 01:22:55,681
You having a baby?

692
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:58,225
Warlord Junior.

693
01:22:58,476 --> 01:22:59,727
Gonna be so ugly.

694
01:23:00,352 --> 01:23:01,770
It could be a girl.

695
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:05,232
You kill people with that, do you?

696
01:23:05,524 --> 01:23:07,568
Killed everyone I ever met out here.

697
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:10,154
Headshots. All of them.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

698
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:12,364
Thought somehow you girls
were above that.

699
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:18,162
Come here.

700
01:23:25,878 --> 01:23:26,879
Take a peek.

701
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,131
Seeds.

702
01:23:30,132 --> 01:23:31,592
These are from home.

703
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:34,011
Heirlooms. The real thing.

704
01:23:34,678 --> 01:23:36,514
I plant one every chance I get.

705
01:23:36,764 --> 01:23:37,765
Where?

706
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,060
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

707
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:43,145
Aah. So many different kinds.

708
01:23:43,437 --> 01:23:45,481
Trees, flowers, fruit.

709
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,567
Back then, everyone had their fill.

710
01:23:49,276 --> 01:23:51,487
Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody.

711
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:07,962
Can I talk to you?

712
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:30,109
I've talked with the others.

713
01:24:36,907 --> 01:24:40,160
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

714
01:24:42,329 --> 01:24:46,333
If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

715
01:24:46,584 --> 01:24:49,086
...we can maybe ride for 160 days.

716
01:24:51,797 --> 01:24:53,757
One of those bikes is yours.

717
01:24:54,883 --> 01:24:56,135
Fully loaded.

718
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:01,432
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

719
01:25:05,436 --> 01:25:07,396
I'll make my own way.

720
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:16,155
You know, hope is a mistake.

721
01:25:23,037 --> 01:25:26,332
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh...

722
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:29,877
You'll go insane.

723
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,686
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

724
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,023
<i>Where are you?</i>

725
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,693
<i>Help us. You promised to help us.</i>

726
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,373
<i>Come on, Pa! Let's go.</i>

727
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:40,406
All right.

728
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,909
This is your way home.

729
01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:48,455
We go back?

730
01:26:48,914 --> 01:26:50,457
Mm.

731
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,501
- Back?
- Yeah.

732
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:54,461
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

733
01:26:54,712 --> 01:26:55,921
What are they saying?

734
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:58,382
He wants to go back from where they came.

735
01:26:58,632 --> 01:26:59,800
The Citadel.

736
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:02,219
What's there to find at the Citadel?

737
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:04,179
Green.

738
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:05,764
And water.

739
01:27:07,015 --> 01:27:10,894
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.

740
01:27:11,145 --> 01:27:13,564
Got everything you need.
Long as you're not afraid of heights.

741
01:27:13,814 --> 01:27:14,940
Where does the water come from?

742
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:18,861
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself.

743
01:27:19,111 --> 01:27:21,363
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.

744
01:27:21,613 --> 01:27:22,781
I don't like him already.

745
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:25,409
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

746
01:27:25,659 --> 01:27:26,577
No.

747
01:27:26,827 --> 01:27:29,538
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

748
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:32,666
Through the canyon.

749
01:27:33,709 --> 01:27:37,588
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

750
01:27:38,088 --> 01:27:41,467
So we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

751
01:27:41,717 --> 01:27:42,718
We can decouple the tanker...

752
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:44,219
...at the pass.

753
01:27:44,595 --> 01:27:46,096
Shut it off behind us.

754
01:27:46,346 --> 01:27:47,473
Kaboom.

755
01:27:50,309 --> 01:27:52,853
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

756
01:27:53,395 --> 01:27:55,189
Assuming we're still alive by then.

757
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,025
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

758
01:27:58,275 --> 01:28:02,029
All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

759
01:28:02,738 --> 01:28:04,490
And we'll be with Nux.

760
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:06,366
He's a War Boy.

761
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:09,244
He'll be bringing us home.
Bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

762
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:13,832
Yeah.

763
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:16,376
It feels like hope.

764
01:28:17,586 --> 01:28:19,129
I like this plan.

765
01:28:19,713 --> 01:28:20,714
We can start again.

766
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:23,050
Just like the old days!

767
01:28:24,635 --> 01:28:25,844
Look.

768
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,263
It'll be a hard day.

769
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:31,809
But I guarantee you
that a 160 days' ride that way...

770
01:28:34,144 --> 01:28:36,188
...there's nothing but salt.

771
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:41,527
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

772
01:28:43,028 --> 01:28:44,279
...together...

773
01:28:45,864 --> 01:28:47,950
...come across some kind of redemption.

774
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,107
War Rig!

775
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:22,317
That's the War Rig!

776
01:29:32,327 --> 01:29:33,537
That's them.

777
01:29:33,787 --> 01:29:35,038
Why are they going back?

778
01:29:35,497 --> 01:29:37,165
Do they wish to surrender?

779
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,376
They are heading for the canyon.

780
01:29:41,253 --> 01:29:44,214
They're going back to the Citadel!

781
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:46,133
They know it's undefended!

782
01:29:46,383 --> 01:29:47,467
Bollocks!

783
01:29:48,844 --> 01:29:49,970
Roll up!

784
01:30:00,272 --> 01:30:01,523
Go!

785
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:25,380
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

786
01:30:25,631 --> 01:30:26,590
To who?

787
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,300
Anyone that's listening.

788
01:30:52,699 --> 01:30:53,659
Here we go, girls!

789
01:30:56,328 --> 01:30:57,579
That's mine!

790
01:31:01,959 --> 01:31:03,919
He'll try to get in front of us.
Spike our wheels.

791
01:31:11,218 --> 01:31:12,260
Don't blow my engine.

792
01:31:12,803 --> 01:31:13,804
Gonna nudge him.

793
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:15,138
Just a little.

794
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:31,071
You filth! You traitored him!

795
01:31:35,951 --> 01:31:36,743
Yeah!

796
01:31:55,095 --> 01:31:55,804
Go.

797
01:31:57,848 --> 01:31:59,391
Aah! Aah!

798
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:10,527
Ha!

799
01:32:11,528 --> 01:32:12,195
Aah!

800
01:32:22,289 --> 01:32:22,873
Gotta back off.

801
01:32:23,999 --> 01:32:26,418
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

802
01:32:26,668 --> 01:32:27,252
Right.

803
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:29,087
Are you a Black Thumb?

804
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:30,380
Uh-huh.

805
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,882
All right. Engine one. Now.

806
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:33,467
You and me. Fifth wheel.

807
01:32:33,884 --> 01:32:35,010
We'll unhook the tanker.

808
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:48,565
One man, one bullet.

809
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:08,168
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

810
01:33:08,418 --> 01:33:09,586
I can't see.

811
01:33:29,606 --> 01:33:30,398
Oh.

812
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,960
Hey!

813
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:51,711
Harpoons and plows!

814
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:53,338
They're hauling us back!

815
01:34:04,599 --> 01:34:06,810
Leave three bolts. Three.

816
01:35:25,347 --> 01:35:26,097
Hey, you! Aargh!

817
01:35:41,988 --> 01:35:43,281
Are you okay?

818
01:35:45,992 --> 01:35:47,619
I think she's hurt.

819
01:36:11,476 --> 01:36:12,269
Hey!

820
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:39,212
No!

821
01:36:43,591 --> 01:36:44,551
No!

822
01:36:49,389 --> 01:36:50,724
<i>Hey.</i>

823
01:36:51,266 --> 01:36:51,933
<i>Stay with me.</i>

824
01:36:52,517 --> 01:36:54,269
<i>- Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

825
01:36:54,519 --> 01:36:55,895
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey! Are you there?

826
01:36:57,772 --> 01:36:58,732
You finish that! I'll finish her!

827
01:37:07,407 --> 01:37:08,074
Unh!

828
01:38:29,614 --> 01:38:30,240
Valhalla!

829
01:38:44,838 --> 01:38:46,005
Aah!

830
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:52,554
Ha!

831
01:39:11,322 --> 01:39:12,157
Engine one's good.

832
01:39:13,283 --> 01:39:14,451
For now.

833
01:40:02,665 --> 01:40:04,083
She's hurt! She's hurt...

834
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:05,376
...real bad!

835
01:40:26,814 --> 01:40:27,482
Aah!

836
01:41:35,758 --> 01:41:36,426
You hear that?

837
01:41:37,427 --> 01:41:39,012
We're gonna see two airborne V8s.

838
01:41:40,555 --> 01:41:42,265
I'm gonna need you to drive.

839
01:41:44,475 --> 01:41:46,144
I'll get him out of our way.

840
01:42:53,169 --> 01:42:54,462
Rictus!

841
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:56,381
Take me!

842
01:43:09,977 --> 01:43:10,728
Cheedo!

843
01:43:10,978 --> 01:43:12,522
- What are you doing?
- Good girl.

844
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:17,985
- Come here.
- Aah!

845
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:21,572
Aah!

846
01:43:23,408 --> 01:43:24,283
Big Boy!

847
01:43:25,368 --> 01:43:27,036
Aah!

848
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,375
Here! Here!

849
01:43:50,643 --> 01:43:51,227
Unh!

850
01:44:26,262 --> 01:44:27,430
Remember me?

851
01:44:30,266 --> 01:44:31,100
Aah!

852
01:44:48,785 --> 01:44:49,827
He's dead!

853
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:51,829
He's dead.

854
01:45:10,848 --> 01:45:13,810
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

855
01:45:14,602 --> 01:45:15,645
Come on!

856
01:45:16,729 --> 01:45:19,273
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

857
01:46:06,904 --> 01:46:08,489
Witness me.

858
01:46:14,954 --> 01:46:15,955
Rictus!

859
01:47:11,552 --> 01:47:13,179
Why is she making that noise?

860
01:47:13,429 --> 01:47:15,139
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

861
01:47:16,015 --> 01:47:17,558
She's collapsing her lungs...

862
01:47:17,808 --> 01:47:19,602
...one breath at a time.

863
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:26,525
I know.

864
01:47:29,487 --> 01:47:30,947
I am so sorry.

865
01:47:33,699 --> 01:47:34,951
I know. I know.

866
01:47:36,202 --> 01:47:37,536
Hold it there.

867
01:47:38,412 --> 01:47:39,497
All right.

868
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:42,875
Put that on there. Press it in. Hey.

869
01:47:44,251 --> 01:47:44,919
Hey.

870
01:47:45,169 --> 01:47:46,295
Home.

871
01:47:53,594 --> 01:47:54,929
Home.

872
01:48:01,352 --> 01:48:03,396
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- She's exsanguinated.

873
01:48:03,646 --> 01:48:04,939
- Drained all her blood.
- Well...

874
01:48:06,524 --> 01:48:07,608
Hold these.

875
01:48:08,442 --> 01:48:09,026
We need that.

876
01:48:10,361 --> 01:48:11,529
Needle.

877
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:13,406
Come on.

878
01:48:14,824 --> 01:48:15,491
Take this.

879
01:48:18,661 --> 01:48:19,453
Keep her awake.

880
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:21,622
Furiosa.

881
01:48:25,292 --> 01:48:27,461
Okay, that's not retracting.

882
01:48:28,129 --> 01:48:29,338
There we go.

883
01:48:30,214 --> 01:48:32,133
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

884
01:48:33,718 --> 01:48:34,885
All right.

885
01:48:35,261 --> 01:48:35,928
Sorry.

886
01:48:38,347 --> 01:48:40,808
There you go. Okay. There you go.

887
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,530
Max.

888
01:48:55,865 --> 01:48:57,366
My name is Max.

889
01:48:58,868 --> 01:49:01,412
Yeah. Mm-hm.

890
01:49:01,746 --> 01:49:03,164
Mm.

891
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:07,710
That's my name.

892
01:49:49,585 --> 01:49:50,252
Brake!

893
01:49:56,133 --> 01:49:57,259
Reveal yourself.

894
01:50:16,403 --> 01:50:17,696
He's got something.

895
01:50:24,995 --> 01:50:25,913
It's Immortan Joe.

896
01:50:26,664 --> 01:50:28,082
The Immortan Joe is dead!

897
01:50:55,276 --> 01:50:56,527
Furiosa!

898
01:50:56,819 --> 01:50:57,987
Furiosa!

899
01:50:58,237 --> 01:50:59,321
Furiosa!

900
01:50:59,572 --> 01:51:00,698
Furiosa!

901
01:51:01,657 --> 01:51:02,867
Furiosa!

902
01:51:03,242 --> 01:51:04,660
She's back.

903
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:07,496
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

904
01:51:07,746 --> 01:51:09,206
<i>Let them up!</i>

905
01:51:09,456 --> 01:51:11,500
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

906
01:51:14,879 --> 01:51:15,921
Come on, let's do it!

907
01:51:16,172 --> 01:51:17,673
Let them up. Come on.

908
01:51:50,206 --> 01:51:51,498
Come on.


1
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:27,433
Good morning. On this day,
July 1st, 2014. At this hour, 0600.

2
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:29,644
We are at the very first airport in the world...

3
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:33,773
The CW-7, which despite being the topic of
so much controversy over the past 7 years,

4
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,942
has continued development.

5
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:41,781
Protests from environmental groups and
a number of developing countries continue...

6
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:47,036
It has been claimed that CW-7
is the answer to global warming.

7
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:48,663
And we are witnessing it!

8
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:53,292
...world leaders, who argue that
global warming can no longer be ignored.

9
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,966
Today, 79 countries will begin dispersing CW-7
into the upper layers of the atmosphere.

10
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,426
...spray out into the upper layers of
the atmosphere and

11
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:06,973
surprisingly bring down average
global temperatures to the finest levels.

12
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,102
It is just a day away that
our long time crisis of global warming...

13
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:16,649
According to scientists, the artificial cooling
substance CW-7 will succeed

14
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,444
in bringing average global temperatures
down to manageable levels,

15
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:24,615
as a revolutionary solution to
mankind's warming of the planet.

16
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,908
Head check!

17
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,666
Alright. Get in line.

18
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,542
Everybody sit down.

19
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,752
One.

20
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,379
Two.

21
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,672
Three.

22
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:03,881
Four.

23
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,091
Five.

24
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,050
Six.

25
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,677
Keep going.

26
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,220
Go on.

27
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,936
Hey you. Sit down!

28
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,313
Curtis, sit down.

29
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,109
Sit down!

30
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,820
I said sit down!

31
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,409
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

32
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,620
Can't you sit and count?
You wanna get shot? You're crazy.

33
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:36,956
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

34
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,628
Are there any experienced violinists here?
Raise your hands!

35
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,422
Violinist!

36
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,382
Stand up, come forward.

37
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,551
Food! Come and get it.

38
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,678
Violinists? They're having a laugh?

39
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,472
Those bastards in the Front Section,
think they own us.

40
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:57,143
Eating steak dinners and listening to
string quartets and that.

41
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,520
We'll be different when we get there.

42
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,815
I want steak.

43
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,155
Excuse me sir!

44
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:13,326
My wife and I played violin
in the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

45
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,244
I was first chair.

46
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:16,787
Can you still play?

47
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,497
Of course. You never forget.

48
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,541
Show me your hands.

49
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,087
You. Follow me.

50
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,340
Leave your belongings, we just need your hands.

51
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:29,342
Not both?

52
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:31,469
Yes. Both hands.

53
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:35,181
My wife, Doris, plays beautifully.
Better than me even.

54
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,350
They just need one person.

55
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,227
Then I won't go.

56
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,688
Doris, Doris.

57
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,611
Sit down everyone.

58
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,696
- Sit down, Edgar.
- They can't just...

59
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:52,198
Sit down.

60
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:54,575
Fucking bastards.

61
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,202
Now isn't the time.

62
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,787
Well when is the time?

63
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,663
Soon.

64
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,626
Doris, I'll be back Doris. It's alright.

65
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,630
I'll come back.

66
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,232
What does the steak taste like again?

67
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,275
I had it once, but I can't remember...

68
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,403
If you can't remember then it's better to forget.

69
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,572
Alright then, what does it,
what does it smell like when it's cooking and that?

70
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,491
When it emanates around the place.

71
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,910
Curtis, is this it?

72
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,245
It's not it.

73
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,538
And I've heard this...

74
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,748
Curtis! Here!

75
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,214
Tim-bo. How's it hanging, buddy?

76
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,426
Give me a pound. Blow it up.

77
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:58,431
Hey, listen. I think I need that protein block.

78
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,892
How about I trade you? This one for that one?

79
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:05,688
No.

80
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,190
Nice bargaining, Curtis. Here.
Give me this one, I'll give you that.

81
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,942
Hey, relax, relax.

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,986
Come here, Timmy. Come here.

83
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,989
Come right...

84
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,117
I have an idea.

85
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:22,955
I'll give you this one and that one for that one.

86
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:24,582
What do you say?

87
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,833
No.

88
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:27,960
Go get him.

89
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,338
Timmy!

90
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,802
Timothy! Your mom's gonna give you
a damn good spanking!

91
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,304
Where the fuck he went?

92
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,807
Hey, come here. Come here. Give us it. Give us it.

93
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,517
You're alright, Jose. How you doing man?

94
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,897
Timmy! Work with me here!

95
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,648
Edgar, why did you let him get up there?

96
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,151
No, I didn't. He got up there by himself.
He's very nimble.

97
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,278
- He's five.
- He's a very nimble five year old.

98
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:57,239
Timmy! Sweetie, come down.

99
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,410
Come here.

100
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,162
What do you want for it?

101
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,331
In the whole wide train?

102
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,333
In the whole wide train.

103
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,667
The ball!

104
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,922
The ball? No, no, I'm sorry,
I can't do that. I can't do that.

105
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:16,842
Yes. I get the ball for a whole hour.

106
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:24,517
Done.

107
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,020
Curtis. Is it time?

108
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,524
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

109
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,713
Red letter?

110
00:08:55,048 --> 00:09:00,135
Yeah. It's the one we've been waiting for.
Our informant gave us the name.

111
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:05,558
N, A, M...

112
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:08,644
Nam Koong Min Soo.

113
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:12,147
He's a security expert.
He's in the Prison Section now.

114
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,066
Wait! You're joking, right?

115
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,568
- He's in prison?
- Hey, out of here.

116
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,986
No, I'm just saying, what kind of
chance do we have...

117
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:17,903
Edgar.

118
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,865
I just think that if this guys says that
he's such a great security expert

119
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:22,950
why can't he just break himself...

120
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,369
That's enough! Go!

121
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,959
Let's go, Tim. Come on. Let's go.

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,968
Edgar just wants to help, you know.
He thinks the world of you.

123
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:45,639
He shouldn't worship me the way he does.
I'm not who he thinks I am.

124
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,768
Few of us ever are.

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,733
Alright. We're here, Tail Section,
Quarantine Section, Prison Section.

126
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,776
Gate.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,820
Gate.

128
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:58,986
Gate.

129
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,947
Four seconds when all three gates are opened at once.

130
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:06,535
We have four seconds to go through
three gates and bust Nam out.

131
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:09,913
Then Nam gets us the rest of the way?

132
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,627
Our fate depends on this man?

133
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:22,635
Yeah. If we can get him to cooperate,
he can take us all the way to the front of the train.

134
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,306
Very front section.

135
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,016
Yeah.

136
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:36,565
From here right to the front of the train.
Everything in one stroke.

137
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:40,861
We control the engine, we control the world.

138
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,030
Without that, we have nothing.

139
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,700
All past revolutions have failed because
they couldn't take the engine.

140
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,702
What are you saying?

141
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,164
This time, we take the engine.

142
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,667
Then what?

143
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:58,837
We kill him.

144
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,255
Wilford?

145
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,514
You should run the train now, not Wilford.

146
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:12,893
I'm a shadow of my former shadow.

147
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:18,023
My day was decades ago.

148
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,652
How old is Gilliam?

149
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,654
Shut up, Edgar.

150
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,783
And listen, I'm not saying that I want that
to happen, that's not what I'm saying.

151
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,496
What I mean is he will die someday.

152
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,459
And when that happens
you're gonna have to take over.

153
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,505
You're gonna have to run the train.

154
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,633
I'm not a leader.

155
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,974
I don't know. I think you'd be
pretty good if you ask me.

156
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:04,945
Hey, Edgar.

157
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,741
How far back can you remember?

158
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:15,247
- I don't know, like what?
- Your mother. You remember her?

159
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:25,132
I can remember her face, every once in a while...

160
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:29,511
But it's not clear.

161
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,933
Stay down everybody.
Everybody stay in your place.

162
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,518
Don't fucking look at me!

163
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,605
Keep down, keep down!

164
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:48,864
Medical Inspection. All the kids.
All the kids come with me. Just the kids.

165
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,951
All the kids.

166
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,665
Stay back there, ma'am. Just stay back there.
Stay back there. Stay.

167
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,585
Hello, what's this? We have one more.
Yup, come.

168
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:04,229
No, no, all need to go.
Come on.

169
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:06,066
No, no, we don't need to.
There's nothing wrong with him.

170
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,468
It's just a little medical check, sir. You just
stay back there. You just stay back there.

171
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,443
You! Go and check!

172
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:09,236
Don't move! Stay there!

173
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,738
Go, Timmy, go! Go!

174
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,591
That's her baby!

175
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,053
Andy!

176
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:41,226
Give me my son, you fucking bitch!

177
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:44,229
Andy! Andy!

178
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,942
How did you let him throw his shoe?

179
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:59,661
Timmy!

180
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:29,441
At this altitude, we need only 7 minutes.

181
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:16,071
Seven minutes allotted for your speech, sir.

182
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:26,081
This is so disappointing.

183
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,460
No no, we don't need all that.
We've only got seven minutes.

184
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,721
Passengers.

185
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:47,561
This is not a shoe. This is disorder.

186
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:51,314
This is size ten chaos.

187
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:55,610
This. See this. This is death.

188
00:16:56,446 --> 00:17:00,032
In this locomotive we call home,
there is one thing

189
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,201
that between our warm hearts and the bitter cold.

190
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,539
Clothing? Shields? No! Order.

191
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,044
Order is the barrier that
holds back the frozen death.

192
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:18,216
We must all of us, on this train of life,
remain in our allotted station.

193
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:25,223
We must each of us occupy
our preordained particular position.

194
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:35,984
Would you wear a shoe on your head?
Of course you wouldn't wear a shoe on your head.

195
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:40,530
A shoe doesn't belong on your head.
A shoe belongs on your foot.

196
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,408
A hat belongs on your head.

197
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,203
I am a hat. You are a shoe.

198
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,331
I belong on the head. You belong on the foot.

199
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,750
Yes? So it is.

200
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,837
In the beginning, order
was prescribed by your ticket.

201
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,674
First class, economy, and free loaders like you.

202
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:04,262
Eternal order is prescribed by the Sacred Engine.

203
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:09,434
All things flow from the Sacred Engine.
All things in their place.

204
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,728
All passengers in their section.

205
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:15,107
All water flowing, all heat
rising pays homage

206
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:24,074
to the Sacred Engine. In its own
par-ti-cu-lar pre-ordained position.

207
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,118
So it is.

208
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,749
Now, as in the beginning, I belong to the front.

209
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:37,087
You belong to the tail.

210
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:44,302
When the foot seeks the place of the head,
a sacred line is crossed.

211
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,638
Know your place!

212
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,723
Keep your place!

213
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,476
Be a shoe!

214
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,861
We have 42 seconds left.

215
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:04,239
So we could go to a comment of Mr. Wilford,

216
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:07,576
the Divine Keeper of the Sacred Engine.

217
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,413
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

218
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,082
Are you there?

219
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:24,467
Are you there, sir?
Oh, it's breaking off.

220
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,013
Mr. Wilford is a very busy man.

221
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,348
So it is.

222
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,368
- Are we just gonna watch?
- Not now.

223
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:52,579
I'm not just gonna fucking sit here...

224
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:28,907
No, I'm alright.

225
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:36,957
Stop. Stop right there. Sit down!

226
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:40,210
Put that useless gun down, put it away.

227
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:45,048
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam. It's a pleasure.

228
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:50,428
You look healthy.

229
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,223
He's fine.

230
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,945
Minister Mason, please deliver
a message to Mr. Wilford.

231
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,530
Certainly. What shall I say?

232
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,616
Tell him, he and I need to talk.

233
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,786
Well. You can talk to me.

234
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:18,164
Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here...

235
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,127
Not here. At the front.

236
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,814
Your son will be a hero. Promise.

237
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:44,649
Or daughter, whatever it is.

238
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,609
I got it, I got it.

239
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,823
Your contribution has been duly noted. Thanks.

240
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:56,828
So sorry to interrupt you while you're praying.

241
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:57,996
What are you doin', man?

242
00:21:58,164 --> 00:21:59,247
So sorry. <i>Sumimasen.</i>

243
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,709
Look. There's your Buddha back, thanks very much.

244
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:08,631
Move, move, move!

245
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,302
Stop fooling around!

246
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:41,956
I've got a better batch.

247
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:46,711
Stronger, fresh, uncut.
Wanna try some?

248
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:50,924
How many protein blocks for
ten rocks of uncut Kronole?

249
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:01,643
They don't have bullets.

250
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:04,104
Why do you say that?

251
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,817
You remember what Mason said?
She said, "Put down that useless gun."

252
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:13,780
She meant she wouldn't
give the order to shoot me.

253
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:15,782
No.

254
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:18,660
No, I think the guns are literally useless.

255
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:22,539
They used up all their bullets
four years ago, in the last revolt.

256
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,543
Bullets are extinct.

257
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:31,756
If you're wrong, we could be finished
before we even start.

258
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:37,929
I think we should be patient.
Wait for the next red letter.

259
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,781
Stay together. Left and right.

260
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:01,453
Not yet. Up, up. Now left, to the left.

261
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:04,914
Good, now forward.

262
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:20,972
Hello, Andrew! Andrew!

263
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:24,726
Wake up, rise and shine.

264
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:28,605
When you dream too much 
of the sun, you forget the trees.

265
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,942
I believe this is your son.

266
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:39,949
I'm, I'm sorry, it's not very good.
It's not my best work, it's a little dark.

267
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:45,455
But if you look very deep into the eyes,
you can see a little bit of hope.

268
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:48,249
What about my boy?
You've got one of Timmy?

269
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:53,213
Oh yes, Tanya, I do. Easy, easy.
Come off this easy. You'll hurt yourself.

270
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,549
Here, there you go. Timmy.

271
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,680
Look at him.

272
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,351
Funny little smile.

273
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,029
Curtis, you gotta let me come with you.

274
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,739
No, Tanya. I'm sorry.

275
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:22,075
You will be if you don't let me come.

276
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:25,578
I'm going to the front and I'mma make that
bitch sorry she put her hands on my boy.

277
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,330
Make this one tighter.

278
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,543
You know I'm stronger than
all these skinny ass soldiers anyway.

279
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:36,548
Please!

280
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:40,760
Oh shit, what's going on?

281
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,720
They changed the schedule, boys. Move it back!

282
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,056
Now or never! They're coming now!

283
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,559
Don't panic! Stick with the plan.

284
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:52,230
Hide that! Hide it in your clothes!
Hide your weapons in your clothes!

285
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,444
Head check.

286
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:02,365
Line up.

287
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:08,121
Alright, sit down.

288
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:13,209
One, two, three, four...

289
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:14,836
What the fuck do we do?

290
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,716
I've had enough of this protein block bullshit!

291
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,134
Yeah, this is bullshit!

292
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:22,093
We're fucking hungry, man!

293
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,595
I want chicken!

294
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,119
We're not gonna sit down for this shite!

295
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:29,259
We want chicken! Chicken!

296
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:37,025
It's okay.

297
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,527
You want him fucking dead? Is that it?

298
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,279
Be quiet!

299
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:44,282
Still going for it, are we?

300
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,162
Come on, let's go! Let's do it.

301
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,294
The rifles.

302
00:26:56,462 --> 00:27:00,131
No, we can overwhelm them.
We easily outnumber their bullets.

303
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,305
This is it.

304
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:11,726
Curtis, come on. We're out of time.
You gotta do it now.

305
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,659
They've got no bullets!

306
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:49,157
I'm fine, Grey. You go now!

307
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:19,687
"Nam Koong Min Soo. Kronole Addict."
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

308
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:20,688
Hurry up, Edgar.

309
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,231
Hurry up?

310
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:27,987
So sorry for keeping you all waiting.
Obviously I work here.

311
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,116
Open it.

312
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,367
Here we go!

313
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:50,468
Hey, Kronole head!

314
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:56,557
So, this is Kronole?
I heard it's pretty big in the front section.

315
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,976
Careful, that's how these guys hallucinate.

316
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:04,315
It's industrial waste.
And it's highly flammable.

317
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:27,630
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo? Security specialist?

318
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:34,679
Did you design all the door locks
and security systems on the train?

319
00:30:35,597 --> 00:30:39,600
Look at him man, he's gone. Look at his eyes.
He's fried his brain with that fucking shite.

320
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:42,353
Are you Nam?

321
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:03,291
Nam, are you listening?

322
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:10,381
Yes, I'm listening, fuck.

323
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,900
It's not "Nem", it's "Nam".
Namgoong Minsoo, shit.

324
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,500
Surname is Namgoong,
first name is Minsoo, asshole.

325
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:26,522
Unknown words found.
Please try again with correct vocabulary.

326
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:29,859
We need your help.

327
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,485
For what?

328
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:36,616
We're going to the front and
we need you to open up the gates.

329
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,661
What if I say no?

330
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,123
Uncut. Straight from the barrel.

331
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:48,085
Every door you open, you get one lump of Kronole.

332
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,728
Jesus! Marlboro Light?

333
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,402
I can't believe it. Cigarettes have been
extinct for more than 10 years now.

334
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,623
Do you want some, asshole?

335
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:30,795
I bet you fuckhead never smoked one before.

336
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:36,133
I'm gonna make this real simple for you.
You help us, you get your drug.

337
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:40,846
If not, we put you back where we found you.
What'll it be, asshole?

338
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,939
Chan.

339
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,650
Chan. Get outta here. Just get out.

340
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,175
Hey, that's enough.

341
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:21,721
Put him back in the fucking drawer!

342
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,658
Get up.

343
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,464
My Daughter, Yona.
If I go, she goes too.

344
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:58,382
So, you're coming with us?

345
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:06,599
One gate, 2 lumps of Kronole.

346
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:09,226
She's an addict, too?

347
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:35,669
Nobody there.

348
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,298
Kronole.

349
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:03,614
Look at all these beds. Where is everybody?

350
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,533
Looks like they left in a hurry.

351
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,994
There's some food on the table.

352
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,293
This can't be a window, can it?

353
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,605
Still cold.

354
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:52,663
Dead. All dead.

355
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:08,095
Alright! Let's go everyone!

356
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:09,972
Stay focus. We didn't come here for this.

357
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,599
Alright! You heard the man. Let's go! Move!

358
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,684
Nem! Nam!

359
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:19,940
Kronole.

360
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:22,234
How did you know there was nobody there?

361
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,196
He's running.

362
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,916
Paul?

363
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:39,293
Paul!

364
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,378
What the hell is he doing, man? Paul!

365
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:42,254
He looks so different.

366
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:47,218
Yeah, just a second. Used to be automatic.
But parts went extinct.

367
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:48,886
He's not the Paul I remember.

368
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,472
No. Paul! It's Curtis!

369
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,059
Ain't comin' back... so now I got to do it.

370
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,562
Manually!

371
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:03,567
So that's how it's made. Still hot.

372
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:08,322
Look at them all! Man, you did some nice work!

373
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,408
That's right, man! There's your food!
There's your protein blocks!

374
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:14,370
Is this why they took you? To make this garbage?

375
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,122
Paul?

376
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,251
You've been alone this whole time?

377
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:25,089
Alone! In the zone!

378
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:29,802
We're going to the front. Come with us!

379
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,263
Oh, right! You're going to the front? Yeah, man!

380
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,933
But, no way man. My place is here. Alright?

381
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:38,727
Here? Making this crap? Why?

382
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,127
You can't draw this.

383
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,462
Okay.

384
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:12,803
All this time, we've been eating this shit?

385
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,389
Hey, I eat them too, you know.

386
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,558
Every single day.

387
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:21,812
Where did you get this?

388
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,190
Have you been the one writing these?

389
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:27,901
I don't write 'em.

390
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,321
Why do you have this? Who gave this to you?

391
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:38,329
They just leave 'em for me ,man. I put them
in the protein blocks. I send them on. That's it!

392
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:44,168
The Water Supply Section?

393
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:50,549
Yeah. It's just a few cars up. It's where
the water's cleansed and recycled.

394
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:53,427
It's one of the most
crucial sections in the train.

395
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:57,014
If we take it, we have the upper hand?

396
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:59,808
We don't even have to
go to the very front.

397
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:05,022
We control the water, we control the negotiation.

398
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:12,780
Uh, hi, hi, excuse me. Sorry to bother you there.

399
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:16,033
Can I get you a glass of water or
something to speed this up?

400
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,706
Listen! Would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all fucking waiting!

401
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,042
Am I?

402
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:26,210
Yeah, you are.

403
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:29,296
Although you've been
fucking smelling that flammable shite,

404
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:33,175
that time is probably a distant
fucking concept for you, isn't it?

405
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,929
Of course, I'm only doing this for Kronole.

406
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:40,474
Here we go again, Kronole this, Kronole that.

407
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:43,250
Christ almighty, man. Do some fucking work!

408
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:46,021
You're the one who gives it to me.

409
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:49,858
Are you a bit thick? That's what you ask for
each time you open a gate!

410
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:53,695
Of course, I'm only doing this for Kronole.

411
00:39:57,033 --> 00:39:59,618
Yona. It's Yona, right?

412
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:02,996
How old are you?

413
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:06,834
Seventeen.

414
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,753
Seventeen. You're a train baby, then?

415
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:13,632
How 'bout you?

416
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:19,972
Seventeen years on Earth.
Seventeen years in the Tail Section.

417
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,101
Earth? What was it like?

418
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,270
I don't remember.

419
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,105
Why?

420
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:32,067
I don't want to remember anything
before I met Gilliam.

421
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:37,906
Yona.

422
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,201
Are you clairvoyant?

423
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,871
Clairvoyant? What's that?

424
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:50,752
Well, you always seem to know what's behind the gates.
Do you see things in your mind?

425
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,145
Don't open it.

426
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:09,521
What?

427
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:12,733
Lock the gate!

428
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,917
Be careful.

429
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,838
Yeah, you too.

430
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:27,117
Team 2 move!

431
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:28,869
Move forward!

432
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:37,414
Passing Yekaterina Bridge!

433
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,332
We're at the bridge, guys!

434
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,251
Ten. Nine.

435
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:44,212
Eight. Seven. Six.

436
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,173
Five. Four.

437
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:49,384
Three. Two. One.

438
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:56,057
Happy New Year!

439
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:59,436
Fucking hate getting old, I fucking hate it.

440
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:04,232
Wilford! Banzai! Banzai!

441
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:09,070
Everybody down!

442
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:10,864
Hang on!

443
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:20,999
Impact!

444
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:28,799
Not yet! A second one!

445
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,843
Stay down!

446
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,444
Nam, what are you doing man? What are you doing?

447
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,905
He's high as a fucking kite.

448
00:46:58,162 --> 00:46:59,746
Here it comes.

449
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:34,489
Safe passage.

450
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:40,704
Hey, watch it! Watch out!
Come on!

451
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:56,511
One, two, three. One, two.

452
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:02,893
Happy Yekaterina Bridge, you filthy ingrates!

453
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:08,231
You people, who if not for the benevolent Wilford,

454
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:12,694
would have frozen solid 18 years ago today!

455
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:15,780
You people...

456
00:48:15,948 --> 00:48:22,245
Who have sucked on the generous titty of Wilford
ever since, for food and shelter!

457
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:30,569
And now, in front of
our hallowed water supply section, no less!

458
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:36,544
You repay his kindness with
violent hooliganism?

459
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:41,473
You scum.

460
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,105
Precisely 74% of you shall die.

461
00:48:55,321 --> 00:49:00,075
My friend, you suffer from
the misplaced optimism of the doomed.

462
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:02,786
This is going to be good.

463
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:13,296
What? What did you say?

464
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:15,674
He said you guys are fucked.

465
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:19,719
You stupid Tail Sectioners.

466
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:25,183
There's a tunnel right after Yekaterina Bridge.

467
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:25,976
A tunnel?

468
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:27,936
Mm-hmm, a fucking long one!

469
00:49:28,104 --> 00:49:29,479
Let's go.

470
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:35,151
Everybody back!

471
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,560
Chan. Get outta here. Just get out.

472
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:58,068
Chan! We need fire!

473
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:00,361
Chan! Bring the fire!

474
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:03,406
Tell them in the back
we need to get the lights up here!

475
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:05,784
Chan has the matches!

476
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,982
Got you, motherfucker!

477
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:43,938
Officer Fuyu! What are you doing?
Don't look at me, you dozy bugger!

478
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:47,281
Look there!

479
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:01,339
Put me down! Stop squeezing my legs!

480
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,566
Surrender!

481
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:26,656
Surrender! Surrender!
He will kill me if we don't surrender!

482
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:31,286
Shit...

483
00:52:57,313 --> 00:52:59,147
Curtis!

484
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:54,953
Stop! Stop everybody!

485
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:56,996
Drop your weapon.

486
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:02,252
Stop!

487
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:04,087
Everybody stop!

488
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:13,513
Do what he says, for crying out loud.

489
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:17,976
Drop your weapons!

490
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:19,537
Don't look.

491
00:56:00,245 --> 00:56:05,416
Survivors! Wash yourselves!

492
00:56:07,753 --> 00:56:10,380
The Water Supply Section.

493
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:15,093
Wash away the blood.

494
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:45,665
Have you seen these kids?

495
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,584
I don't know anything about...

496
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:55,258
Look! Where are they, you bitch?

497
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:59,595
I don't know. I don't know.
It's not me. It's not me.

498
00:57:00,681 --> 00:57:02,265
Tell us or I'll cut your fucking arm off.

499
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:04,225
Even shorter than mine, you bastard!

500
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:06,811
Wilford... Wilford knows.

501
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:10,606
Wil... Wilford... Wilford likes kids.

502
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:15,862
He does. That's why he sends that
yellow one Claude to get them for him...

503
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:18,698
It... it's Wilford you want, not me.

504
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:21,117
Wilford likes kids?

505
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:24,203
All he cares about is his wretched engine!

506
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:26,247
The Engine is Sacred.

507
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:28,958
And Wilford is Divine.

508
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:32,003
Wilford is merciful.

509
00:57:34,882 --> 00:57:39,051
Call him. See if he'll come save you.

510
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:41,345
Yes.

511
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:45,308
Wilford The Merciful. Call him.

512
00:57:46,268 --> 00:57:49,896
He won't come here. He won't leave his Engine.

513
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:54,066
We're going to rip you into little pieces.
He still won't come?

514
00:57:57,696 --> 00:58:01,449
Well, we control the water.
We turn that off, he'll have to come.

515
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,493
Turn off the water?

516
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:07,663
Well, you'll only be condemning your own people.

517
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,541
The water comes from the front.

518
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:15,546
The nose of the train breaks up the snow
and ice and turns it into water.

519
00:58:15,714 --> 00:58:21,677
It's like an elephant's trunk. The water
comes in the mouth, not in the bum.

520
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:23,054
Curtis!

521
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,850
Yes. Wilford knows you well, Mr. Curtis Everett.

522
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,019
He's been watching you.

523
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:33,564
And we know you won't harm your own people.

524
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:37,193
Too bad you couldn't save
your second in command.

525
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:40,613
- What was his name, Edgar?
- Shut the fuck up!

526
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:42,406
Curtis! Curtis! I can help you!

527
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:44,575
You can fucking die is what you can do.

528
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:47,078
No, I can help you! I swear it!

529
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:48,929
Listen, listen to me!

530
00:58:48,997 --> 00:58:51,582
Wilford won't come here! He's not coming!

531
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,501
You've got to go to him!

532
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:57,046
And I can take you. I know the train.

533
00:58:57,214 --> 00:58:58,589
I can guarantee you safe passage.

534
00:58:58,757 --> 00:59:00,758
Why the fuck would I trust you?

535
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:05,263
Because I want to live.

536
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,183
So you'd sell out Wilford The Benevolent?

537
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:14,814
If I take you to the front,
you have to kill him.

538
00:59:15,524 --> 00:59:20,278
I'll get you close enough.
You kill him and let me live.

539
00:59:27,703 --> 00:59:29,120
Curtis?

540
00:59:37,421 --> 00:59:39,755
You're still determined to push ahead?

541
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:44,760
Of course. We're not even halfway.

542
00:59:47,306 --> 00:59:49,974
You've already gone further than anyone else.

543
00:59:52,477 --> 00:59:55,104
Further than MacGregor four years ago.

544
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:00,318
Ten cars, twenty cars, it doesn't matter
unless we make it to the engine.

545
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,237
They'll just regroup and attack us again.

546
01:00:03,822 --> 01:00:05,865
We gotta pull them out by the roots.

547
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:12,413
But so many have been killed.
We've lost so many.

548
01:00:13,915 --> 01:00:14,957
I know.

549
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:19,337
Have you seen our men? They are exhausted.

550
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:25,968
I told them to wash themselves,
so that I could assess the damage.

551
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:49,325
Let me go ahead.

552
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,586
I've got Mason now.
I can move a lot faster.

553
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:03,798
You stay here with the wounded.
Guard the prisoners.

554
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:07,593
When we take the engine,
I'll call for you to lead us.

555
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:12,848
Stop it, Curtis. Why are you doing that?

556
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:20,022
You know very well that you're already our leader.

557
01:01:21,817 --> 01:01:24,151
You have to accept that now.

558
01:01:30,117 --> 01:01:32,827
How can I lead if I have two good arms?

559
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:57,393
It's faded a lot.

560
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,779
Better to have both arms.
Can't do a lot with one, you know.

561
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:14,660
Especially when you hold a woman.
It's much better to have two arms, wouldn't you agree?

562
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:29,383
When you get to the narrow bridge,
big gate with the W on it.

563
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:34,096
Wilford's behind that.

564
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,893
Don't let Wilford talk.

565
01:02:41,605 --> 01:02:43,105
Cut out his tongue.

566
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,444
Okay, let's all get in there, squeeze in!

567
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:57,077
Perfect, perfect! The hat becomes you well.

568
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:05,336
Now, Grey... You must go with Curtis.

569
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:17,556
Oops, forgot somebody.

570
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,442
Kronole.

571
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:58,264
Don't mind me. Back to work,
everyone, back to work.

572
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:00,391
Minister.

573
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,183
Are you okay?

574
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:02,101
I'm okay.

575
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:03,310
Please don't eat it, don't eat it.

576
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:06,021
No, no, no, no, they're very friendly.
They won't bite.

577
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:08,399
Well, they might bite the tomato, but...

578
01:04:12,988 --> 01:04:14,488
Can I eat this?

579
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,365
Train baby like you wouldn't know.

580
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,952
I used to walk on this every day.

581
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:23,163
Under the snow this is everywhere.

582
01:04:23,373 --> 01:04:24,373
Earth.

583
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:26,542
What's this?

584
01:04:27,293 --> 01:04:28,418
It's moving.

585
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,379
Over there.

586
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:32,965
What's that?

587
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:55,404
Hey.

588
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:01,577
Do any of you feel like sushi?

589
01:05:01,912 --> 01:05:04,496
Hell yeah, line that shit up.

590
01:05:04,748 --> 01:05:06,081
Right?

591
01:05:10,295 --> 01:05:12,004
You people are very lucky.

592
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:17,426
This is only served twice in a year,
in January and July.

593
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:19,887
Why? Not enough fish?

594
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:22,348
Oh, "enough" is not the criterion.

595
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,391
Balance.

596
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:28,479
You see, this aquarium is
a closed ecological system.

597
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:35,653
The number of individual units must be
very closely, precisely controlled

598
01:05:35,946 --> 01:05:39,615
in order to maintain
the proper sustainable balance.

599
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:22,574
No.

600
01:06:23,326 --> 01:06:24,910
You eat this.

601
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,329
You know what that's made of?

602
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:36,672
Dig in.

603
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:04,908
Curtis, my friend, do you think we might dispense
with the restraints for this next Section?

604
01:07:05,076 --> 01:07:07,703
I am not your friend and why would I?

605
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:11,749
For the sake of the young? Education?

606
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:16,712
Quiet! Quiet!

607
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,547
Good morning, children.

608
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:22,426
I am pleased to present guests from the Tail Section.

609
01:07:22,594 --> 01:07:25,596
Yes and what do we say to
Tail Section guests, children?

610
01:07:25,889 --> 01:07:29,475
Good morning, Tail Section guests.

611
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:31,060
Timmy! Timmy!

612
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:35,564
Andy! Andy! Andrew...

613
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,905
This little boy. His name is Timmy.

614
01:07:43,073 --> 01:07:45,866
This is my son. Please, take a 
good look at the picture!

615
01:07:46,034 --> 01:07:47,076
I saw them!

616
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:48,911
- When?
- Where?

617
01:07:49,162 --> 01:07:51,330
Came through there, went through there.

618
01:07:52,332 --> 01:07:53,999
Is that all, boy?

619
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:55,751
Yes.

620
01:07:57,921 --> 01:07:58,962
Were they crying?

621
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:01,340
No, but they looked like they wanted to.

622
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:05,594
I heard all Tail Sectioners were lazy dogs

623
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,888
who slept all day in their own shit.

624
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:10,682
No, they're very nice!

625
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:14,895
And very just and merciful. So it is.

626
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:18,440
Minister Mason, we were
just about to show a video.

627
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:20,109
Very good!

628
01:08:23,113 --> 01:08:25,322
Wilford!

629
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:30,327
From a very young age, Mr. Wilford's
love of locomotives was apparent.

630
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:34,206
When I grow up, I want to
live in a train. Forever!

631
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:36,458
Forever!

632
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:37,793
His early dreams were realized

633
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:43,465
when he founded his transportation empire
the Wilford Industries.

634
01:08:43,842 --> 01:08:48,095
But his greatest dream was to
construct a luxury locomotive cruise line.

635
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:52,182
Connecting railways of
the entire world into one!

636
01:08:52,475 --> 01:08:56,687
A circular railway that extends for 438,000 kilometers

637
01:08:56,938 --> 01:08:59,314
and completes one circle every year.

638
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:03,944
Impervious to the extreme cold of the Arctic
and the scorching heat of the African desert.

639
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:06,488
Wilford's miracle train is self-sustaining

640
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:10,909
and possesses the most sophisticated designs
and advanced technology known--

641
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:13,078
As hard as it is to believe,

642
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:16,331
people in the Old World made fun of Mr. Wilford.

643
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:22,004
They criticized him for over-engineering
and over-equipping this wonderful train.

644
01:09:22,297 --> 01:09:25,132
But Wilford knew something they did not.

645
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,175
And what was that?

646
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:30,304
Old World people were frigging morons
who got turned into popsicles!

647
01:09:30,722 --> 01:09:33,682
Well, sort of.
Mr. Wilford knew that

648
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,435
CW-7 would freeze the world.

649
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:42,191
So what did the prophetic Mr. Wilford invent to
protect the chosen from that calamity?

650
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:44,484
The Engine!

651
01:09:44,694 --> 01:09:47,029
Rumble, rumble, rattle, rattle.

652
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:49,698
It will never die!

01:09:53,411 --> 01:09:55,370

654
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:57,581

I love that one, such a tonic.

667
01:10:22,774 --> 01:10:27,945
Oh, it's time, children!
Come this way! Don't trip now!

668
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:30,906
Don't push! There's plenty of room.

669
01:10:31,241 --> 01:10:33,283
Who can tell me what's coming up?

670
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:36,411
The Frozen Seven!

671
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:39,748
Pay attention. This tableau
will surely be on the exam!

672
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:44,753
Fifteen years ago, in the third year of
the train, seven passengers tried

673
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:48,924
to stop Wilford's Miracle Train and go outside!

674
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,093
And what do we call this event, Magdalena?

675
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:52,970
The Revolt of the Seven.

676
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:55,764
Very good. Long before you were born.

677
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,727
Of course, they failed to stop the train.
Instead, they jumped out of the running train.

678
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:02,938
Here they come now.

679
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:06,775
You look too.

680
01:11:08,861 --> 01:11:10,028
Why?

681
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:13,365
There they are. That's how far they made it.

682
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:20,539
That person in the front...

683
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:25,127
...was a cleaning lady from the front section.

684
01:11:26,296 --> 01:11:30,132
She was an Inuit. You know, Eskimo.

685
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:34,344
She taught me about every type of snow and ice.

686
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,139
She believed we could survive outside the train.

687
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:39,599
If we ever go outside the train?

688
01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:42,811
We'd all freeze and die!

689
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:44,980
If the engine stops running?

690
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:47,482
We'd all die!

691
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:50,777
And who takes care of the Sacred Engine?

692
01:11:51,029 --> 01:11:53,864
Sir Wilford!

693
01:11:54,532 --> 01:11:57,659
Children! It's the New Year eggs from Mr. Wilford!

694
01:11:58,328 --> 01:12:00,495
Touch them, they are still warm.

695
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:05,334
These eggs are boiled using water
heated by the Sacred Engine itself.

696
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:07,961
As a special treat, we have playing for us,

697
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:12,758
the world-renowned first chair violinist of
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

698
01:12:12,925 --> 01:12:15,093
Mr. Gerald McInster!

699
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:22,851
Is that really Gerald? He looks damn great!

700
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,193
No, thank you very much.

701
01:12:38,951 --> 01:12:40,535
Let's go, Curtis.

702
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:49,628
Happy New Year!

703
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:02,724
I thought the chicken was extinct.

704
01:13:14,737 --> 01:13:17,823
There are actually many things on board
were rumored to be extinct.

705
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,491
Such as?

706
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:23,245
This.

707
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,931
Andrew! No!

708
01:13:56,654 --> 01:13:58,321
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

709
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,374
No.

710
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:35,192
Curtis!

711
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:38,820
You have to lead us.

712
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:53,835
Curtis, my friend.
We understand each other.

713
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:56,129
Listen to my words! It wasn't me!

714
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:16,191
We go forward.

715
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:28,703
Open!

716
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,163
Hurry!

717
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:21,756
It's Mason.

718
01:16:21,924 --> 01:16:23,425
Shit. Check her pulse.

719
01:16:48,618 --> 01:16:50,619
Hey, hey, fire regulation...

720
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:01,981
God, that does not look good.

721
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,709
He's coming.

722
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:36,641
Got the master key, right?

723
01:18:40,688 --> 01:18:42,731
Wait, don't shoot. Please don't shoot.

724
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:21,770
You just killed a Front Section Passenger! I'm...

725
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:26,441
I didn't see a thing.

726
01:19:27,693 --> 01:19:32,071
Where are you going? Wait, just wait a minute!
Can't we talk about it just for one second...

727
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:06,648
You son of a bitch!

728
01:21:34,904 --> 01:21:36,696
Close the door.

729
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:43,805
Tanya.

730
01:22:45,182 --> 01:22:48,267
Oh...

731
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:52,355
My Timmy.

732
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:55,733
My Timmy.

733
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:18,715
We're gonna find him. I promise.

734
01:23:20,843 --> 01:23:22,218
I know.

735
01:23:28,017 --> 01:23:29,517
Thank you.

736
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,455
You grab some too.

737
01:24:41,298 --> 01:24:44,300
<i>Hey, turn around, motherfucker!
You got my Kronole!</i>

738
01:24:44,524 --> 01:24:46,524
<i>I want that shit!</i>

739
01:24:48,348 --> 01:24:50,848
<i>I'm coming after you, man!
I want my Kronole back!</i>

740
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:53,372
<i>That's my Kronole, motherfucker!</i>

741
01:24:58,232 --> 01:25:01,843
<i>I swear, man! I'm gonna kill you, 
you spaced-out fuck!</i>

742
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,049
Open the door.

743
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:54,597
Come on, Kronole.

744
01:26:54,848 --> 01:26:58,559
Kronole? You want Kronole?
Here. Take it.

745
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:02,313
Open it. Open the gate!

746
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,319
You're crazy.

747
01:27:35,973 --> 01:27:38,766
Fucking obsessed with gates.

748
01:27:42,729 --> 01:27:44,522
Here, have a smoke.

749
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:07,420
You should be grateful.

750
01:28:11,508 --> 01:28:15,970
The world's last cigarette, you tail section dick.

751
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:18,681
You ever been to the Tail Section?

752
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:25,396
Do you have any idea what went on
back there? When we boarded?

753
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,029
It was chaos.

754
01:28:36,408 --> 01:28:40,077
Yeah, we didn't freeze to death
but we didn't have time to be thankful.

755
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:43,539
Wilford's soldiers came and they took everything.

756
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:49,378
A thousand people in an iron box.
No food, no water.

757
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:00,681
After a month, we ate the weak.

758
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,822
Do you know what I hate about myself?

759
01:29:20,702 --> 01:29:23,454
I know what people taste like.

760
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,295
I know that babies taste best.

761
01:29:45,268 --> 01:29:51,023
There was a woman. She was hiding with her baby.

762
01:29:53,902 --> 01:30:02,284
Then some men with knives came.
They killed her and they took her baby.

763
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:13,295
And then, an old man...
No relation, just an old man.

764
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:18,300
Stepped forward and he said, "Give me the knife."

765
01:30:20,178 --> 01:30:22,638
And everyone thought he'd kill the baby himself.

766
01:30:24,015 --> 01:30:30,604
But he took the knife, and he cut off his arm.

767
01:30:33,275 --> 01:30:42,491
And he said, "Eat this. If you're so hungry,
eat this. Just leave the baby."

768
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:49,582
I have never seen anything like that.

769
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:56,714
And the men put down their knives.

770
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:03,095
Probably guessed who that old man was.

771
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:10,060
That baby was Edgar.

772
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,359
And I was the man with the knife.

773
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:27,077
I killed Edgar's mother.

774
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:45,221
And then one by one, other people in the
Tail Section started cutting off arms and legs and...

775
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:47,348
...offering them.

776
01:31:48,683 --> 01:31:50,559
It was like a miracle.

777
01:31:57,234 --> 01:32:00,694
And I wanted to.
I tried. I just...

778
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:17,503
A month later, Wilford's soldiers
brought those protein blocks.

779
01:32:17,754 --> 01:32:20,548
We've been eating that shit ever since.

780
01:32:24,886 --> 01:32:27,054
Eighteen years I've hated Wilford.

781
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:35,229
Eighteen years I've waited for this moment.

782
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:43,279
And now I'm here.

783
01:32:59,504 --> 01:33:01,338
Open the gate.

784
01:33:04,175 --> 01:33:05,593
Please.

785
01:33:07,429 --> 01:33:09,805
Thanks for your story, Curtis.

786
01:33:12,142 --> 01:33:14,351
But I don't want to open the gate.

787
01:33:16,104 --> 01:33:18,397
You know what I really want?

788
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:22,693
I want to open the gate.

789
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:28,115
Not this gate.

790
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:31,118
But that one.

791
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,460
The gate to the outside world.

792
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:43,339
It's been frozen shut for eighteen years.

793
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:46,634
You might take it as a wall.

794
01:33:47,844 --> 01:33:50,220
But it's a fucking gate.

795
01:33:51,806 --> 01:33:55,601
Let's open it and just get the hell out.

796
01:33:56,269 --> 01:33:59,438
And freeze to death? What are you, fucking crazy?

797
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:04,818
What if we don't?

798
01:34:06,446 --> 01:34:08,530
What if we could survive outside?

799
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,160
Remember the Yekaterina Bridge?

800
01:34:14,037 --> 01:34:16,705
When you were being chopped up.

801
01:34:17,749 --> 01:34:21,627
There's something I look at every New Year.

802
01:34:21,836 --> 01:34:25,798
Under the snow is a crashed airplane.

803
01:34:28,426 --> 01:34:34,640
Ten years ago, I could barely see the tail.

804
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:39,269
Now I can see its body and its wings.

805
01:34:42,023 --> 01:34:45,109
There's less ice and snow.

806
01:34:45,443 --> 01:34:48,821
In other words, it's melting.

807
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:53,575
The type of snow that's about to melt.

808
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,744
A little push and it all falls down.

809
01:34:58,289 --> 01:35:00,124
Recently...

810
01:35:01,543 --> 01:35:03,961
...you know what I saw?

811
01:35:06,005 --> 01:35:08,006
Outside the window, there was...

812
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:17,891
Nevermind. I don't have to tell you this.

813
01:35:18,268 --> 01:35:20,394
You gotta take it easy on that Kronole.

814
01:35:20,645 --> 01:35:23,480
Snorting that flammable
shit's gonna fry your brain.

815
01:35:24,107 --> 01:35:25,733
That's exactly right.

816
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,819
Kronole is originally...

817
01:35:31,406 --> 01:35:33,949
...an industrial waste, highly flammable.

818
01:35:34,576 --> 01:35:36,285
When it's lit, boom!

819
01:35:38,872 --> 01:35:41,957
Simply put, it's a fucking bomb!

820
01:35:46,963 --> 01:35:50,215
I didn't stock up on it for years just to get high.

821
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:53,385
It's to blow up this gate.

822
01:35:54,262 --> 01:35:55,387
Give me the matches!

823
01:35:55,555 --> 01:35:57,097
What the fuck are you doing?

824
01:35:57,557 --> 01:35:58,766
Give it to me.

825
01:35:58,933 --> 01:36:00,768
Take that off the door.

826
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,702
Curtis Everett.

827
01:36:19,621 --> 01:36:24,833
I've been asked to extend a formal invitation from
Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner.

828
01:36:26,753 --> 01:36:28,378
After you.

829
01:36:55,865 --> 01:36:57,991
Curtis! Is that you?

830
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:03,872
Curtis, dear boy. Come in.

831
01:37:07,377 --> 01:37:09,002
Let's take a look at you.

832
01:37:09,671 --> 01:37:14,842
You hungry? You did a man's
work coming all this way.

833
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:18,303
Please sit down.

834
01:37:18,721 --> 01:37:24,601
You are the first human being to have walked
the total length of this train. Tail to Engine.

835
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:29,064
Did you know that? Well done. Bravo.

836
01:37:30,692 --> 01:37:34,695
None of your people have ever been here.
To the engine.

837
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:37,155
I've never been to the Tail Section.

838
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:40,158
Why not? Too dirty for you?

839
01:37:40,702 --> 01:37:43,245
Don't want to rub against
the vermin of the Tail Section?

840
01:37:43,621 --> 01:37:46,415
Do you think my station is
without its own drawbacks?

841
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:50,586
It's noisy. And it's lonely.

842
01:37:53,047 --> 01:37:54,381
Right.

843
01:37:55,049 --> 01:37:58,051
Steaks. Plenty of room.

844
01:37:58,761 --> 01:38:01,054
This whore to bring you anything you want.

845
01:38:01,514 --> 01:38:06,894
Curtis, everyone has their preordained position.
And everyone is in their place except you.

846
01:38:07,896 --> 01:38:11,398
That's what people in the best place
say to people in the worst place.

847
01:38:13,151 --> 01:38:15,903
There's not a soul on this train
who wouldn't trade places with you.

848
01:38:16,154 --> 01:38:17,905
Would you trade places with me?

849
01:38:18,156 --> 01:38:19,406
Fuck you.

850
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:25,495
Curtis, dear boy, the fact is we are
all stuck inside this blasted train.

851
01:38:25,997 --> 01:38:28,624
We are all prisoners in this hunk of metal.

852
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,500
Medium rare?

853
01:38:30,793 --> 01:38:35,881
And this train is a closed ecosystem.
We must always strive for balance.

854
01:38:36,591 --> 01:38:40,218
The air, the water, the food supply,
the population...

855
01:38:40,386 --> 01:38:42,137
...must be always kept in balance.

856
01:38:42,805 --> 01:38:43,847
For optimum balance,

857
01:38:44,015 --> 01:38:48,352
however, there have been times
when more radical solutions were required.

858
01:38:48,519 --> 01:38:54,024
When the population needed to
be reduced rather drastically.

859
01:38:57,487 --> 01:39:00,405
We don't have time for true natural selection.

860
01:39:01,032 --> 01:39:05,410
We would all be hideously overcrowded
and starved waiting for that.

861
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:13,251
The next best solution is to have individual
units kill off other individual units.

862
01:39:14,212 --> 01:39:17,673
From time to time, we've had to
stir the pot so to speak.

863
01:39:18,049 --> 01:39:19,716
The Revolt of the Seven.

864
01:39:20,093 --> 01:39:24,346
The MacGregor Riots.
The Great Curtis Revolution!

865
01:39:25,098 --> 01:39:28,976
A blockbuster production with
a devilishly unpredictable plot!

866
01:39:29,477 --> 01:39:33,313
Who could have predicted your counterattack
with the torch in the Yekaterina Tunnel?

867
01:39:34,232 --> 01:39:38,485
Pure genius. That wasn't what
Gilliam and I had in our plan.

868
01:39:38,653 --> 01:39:39,987
What?

869
01:39:42,699 --> 01:39:47,077
Don't tell me you didn't know.
Gilliam and I. Our plan.

870
01:39:49,163 --> 01:39:50,455
Gilliam?

871
01:39:50,915 --> 01:39:51,873
Gilliam.

872
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:55,043
The front and the tail
are supposed to work together.

873
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:58,839
He was more than a partner, really.

874
01:39:59,882 --> 01:40:00,674
He was my friend.

875
01:40:00,842 --> 01:40:01,842
Bullshit.

876
01:40:02,301 --> 01:40:03,510
I don't believe you.

877
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:09,391
Our original agreement was for
the insurgency to end at the Yekaterina Tunnel.

878
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,688
And all the survivors would go back to
the Tail Section to enjoy much more space.

879
01:40:14,856 --> 01:40:17,899
You're a fucking liar.
Gilliam would never do that.

880
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,527
It all worked out in the end.

881
01:40:20,903 --> 01:40:24,906
Your counterattack actually made
the insurgency ten times more exciting.

882
01:40:25,324 --> 01:40:29,619
Unfortunately, the front suffered
more losses than anticipated,

883
01:40:30,204 --> 01:40:33,165
and Gilliam had to pay the price.

884
01:40:35,877 --> 01:40:37,544
Ironic, isn't it?

885
01:40:37,962 --> 01:40:42,549
How people dramatically cross that
thin barrier between life and death?

886
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:46,178
Now, there is just one last thing for us to do.

887
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,557
Tally up the numbers.

888
01:41:01,611 --> 01:41:03,779
Hello, Wilford. It's me.

889
01:41:04,405 --> 01:41:06,073
I'm at Gilliam's place.

890
01:41:06,365 --> 01:41:07,616
Hold on.

891
01:41:08,076 --> 01:41:09,743
Is it still the same number?

892
01:41:09,952 --> 01:41:12,662
Yes, it still stands at 74 percent.

893
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:14,664
Okay. Carry on.

894
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:16,416
Wait.

895
01:41:16,793 --> 01:41:20,087
Spare eighteen to celebrate our 18th year.

896
01:41:20,296 --> 01:41:23,757
It's a... An excellent idea. Yes.

897
01:41:31,933 --> 01:41:33,100
Your people.

898
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,145
God damn it, Claude. Mind the Engine!

899
01:41:39,107 --> 01:41:41,108
She's getting sensitive recently.

900
01:41:43,236 --> 01:41:44,945
Sit down and mind your table manners.

901
01:41:47,281 --> 01:41:48,615
Just relax.

902
01:41:51,953 --> 01:41:53,495
Calm down.

903
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:57,415
Boy, now I can see what Gilliam meant.

904
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:01,128
He told me you were brilliant and clever,
but always so tense.

905
01:42:02,505 --> 01:42:04,714
When's the last time you got laid?

906
01:42:06,425 --> 01:42:09,636
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

907
01:42:18,646 --> 01:42:20,480
I'll miss Gilliam.

908
01:42:22,066 --> 01:42:24,317
I'll miss our late night phone chats.

909
01:42:25,987 --> 01:42:31,116
He could go on for hours,
all with only one arm!

910
01:42:32,577 --> 01:42:37,122
What's with that face? What's the matter?

911
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:43,503
You look like a crazy person. As if there
aren't enough crazies on this train!

912
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,325
Blood!

913
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:20,832
Are you okay?

914
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,542
What happened?

915
01:43:24,462 --> 01:43:25,795
Get down!

916
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:42,938
Yona.

917
01:43:43,105 --> 01:43:45,190
Open that gate and get the Kronole!

918
01:43:47,151 --> 01:43:49,736
See those wires inside?

919
01:43:50,363 --> 01:43:51,905
Shit, tons of 'em...

920
01:43:53,032 --> 01:43:55,784
Kill! You punk!

921
01:43:56,577 --> 01:44:02,749
I believe it is easier for someone to survive on
this train if they have some level of insanity.

922
01:44:04,835 --> 01:44:06,962
I mean as Gilliam well understood,

923
01:44:07,129 --> 01:44:11,591
we need to maintain a proper
balance of anxiety and fear,

924
01:44:11,842 --> 01:44:13,677
chaos and horror in order

925
01:44:13,844 --> 01:44:15,553
to keep life going.

926
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:20,433
If we don't have that, we need to invent it.

927
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,269
In that sense,

928
01:44:22,436 --> 01:44:25,772
the Great Curtis Revolution
you invented was truly a masterpiece.

929
01:44:26,649 --> 01:44:27,816
Yona!

930
01:44:28,234 --> 01:44:29,442
Red goes into 8!

931
01:44:29,777 --> 01:44:31,236
No, 7!

932
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:38,785
Come with me, Curtis.

933
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:43,123
Something I want to show you.
You deserve it.

934
01:44:46,544 --> 01:44:48,003
Come on.

935
01:44:56,846 --> 01:44:58,805
She's waking up now.

936
01:45:27,209 --> 01:45:30,545
Cozy, yes? Peaceful.

937
01:45:31,505 --> 01:45:33,340
You are now in her heart.

938
01:45:34,717 --> 01:45:37,719
I've devoted my entire life to this.

939
01:45:39,138 --> 01:45:41,097
The Eternal Engine.

940
01:45:43,351 --> 01:45:45,477
It is eternity itself.

941
01:45:49,065 --> 01:45:51,524
Have you ever been alone on this train?

942
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:59,282
When was the last time you were alone?
You can't remember, can you?

943
01:46:00,951 --> 01:46:04,454
So please do, take your time.

944
01:47:04,765 --> 01:47:06,266
I just wrote it.

945
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,269
It's for you, Curtis.

946
01:47:10,438 --> 01:47:11,855
Here.

947
01:47:24,326 --> 01:47:25,743
I am old.

948
01:47:27,288 --> 01:47:32,959
I want you to take my station.
It's what you always wanted.

949
01:47:37,047 --> 01:47:39,090
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

950
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:45,638
You must tend the Engine, keep her humming.

951
01:47:51,812 --> 01:47:55,982
Look, Curtis. Beyond the gate.

952
01:47:57,943 --> 01:48:01,237
Section after section precisely
where they've always been and

953
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:04,991
where they'll always be all adding up to what?

954
01:48:06,952 --> 01:48:08,661
The train.

955
01:48:10,748 --> 01:48:13,291
And now, the perfectly
correct number of human beings

956
01:48:13,459 --> 01:48:17,295
all in their proper places all adding up to what?

957
01:48:17,796 --> 01:48:19,172
Humanity.

958
01:48:19,632 --> 01:48:24,302
The train is the world, we the humanity.

959
01:48:26,347 --> 01:48:30,683
And now you have the sacred responsibility
to lead all of humanity.

960
01:48:31,727 --> 01:48:34,604
Without you, Curtis, humanity will cease to exist.

961
01:48:36,524 --> 01:48:39,150
You've seen what people do without leadership.

962
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,903
They devour one another.

963
01:49:04,385 --> 01:49:06,094
Yona, the Kronole!

964
01:49:10,391 --> 01:49:11,641
Yona, stop!

965
01:49:15,187 --> 01:49:16,563
No bullet?

966
01:49:23,487 --> 01:49:25,572
Put the Kronole on the gate.

967
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:28,074
Look at them.

968
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:31,411
That's how people are.

969
01:49:32,413 --> 01:49:35,290
You know. You've seen this.

970
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:38,418
You've been this.

971
01:49:41,463 --> 01:49:43,548
Ridiculous, pathetic, aren't they?

972
01:49:44,633 --> 01:49:46,968
You can save them from themselves.

973
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:51,389
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

974
01:49:57,396 --> 01:49:58,771
Curtis.

975
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:01,608
This is your destiny.

976
01:50:06,822 --> 01:50:07,488
It's ready!

977
01:50:07,656 --> 01:50:10,408
Curtis has the match!

978
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:15,455
Curtis!

979
01:50:15,664 --> 01:50:17,123
The match!

980
01:50:50,491 --> 01:50:53,159
The space only allows for a very small person.

981
01:50:55,412 --> 01:50:57,330
Young children under five.

982
01:50:57,831 --> 01:51:02,210
The Engine lasts forever
but not so all of its parts.

983
01:51:02,378 --> 01:51:08,800
That piece of equipment went extinct recently.
We needed a replacement.

984
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:14,722
Thank goodness the Tail Section
manufactures a steady supply of kids.

985
01:51:15,683 --> 01:51:17,517
So we can keep going manually.

986
01:51:20,521 --> 01:51:23,022
You fucking bastard!

987
01:51:46,213 --> 01:51:47,797
Yona.

988
01:51:50,175 --> 01:51:51,634
Take the fire.

989
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:11,028
Only one left!

990
01:52:44,271 --> 01:52:46,397
Andy? Is that you?

991
01:52:48,317 --> 01:52:51,652
Andy! You remember me?

992
01:52:52,112 --> 01:52:54,447
Andy, stop! Listen to me!

993
01:52:54,615 --> 01:52:56,949
Don't go up those stairs! Listen!

994
01:52:58,285 --> 01:52:59,952
Andy!

995
01:53:00,704 --> 01:53:02,747
Come here! Come over here!

996
01:53:05,417 --> 01:53:07,043
Andy, listen to me!

997
01:53:07,753 --> 01:53:09,378
Get out of there!

998
01:53:14,092 --> 01:53:16,552
God damn it, Andy, listen to me!

999
01:53:16,762 --> 01:53:21,224
Oh Curtis, don't be so melodramatic.

1000
01:53:22,267 --> 01:53:25,436
You know everyone has
their own preordained position.

1001
01:55:01,658 --> 01:55:02,909
Nice.

1002
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:22,131
Dad! Dad!

1003
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:28,804
Curtis. Curtis.

1004
01:57:39,983 --> 01:57:41,734
Just stay there!


1
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,028
<i>First stage removal. First stage removal.</i>

2
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:42,245
<i>Streets prohibited to non-permits in one hour.</i>

3
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>This conversation with Governor Henry C. Santini...</i>

4
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:06,185
<i>is brought to you by
Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow...</i>

5

<i>Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.</i>

11
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>And now, Governor Santini.</i>

12
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,126
<i>Thank you, Richard. Thank you.</i>

13
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>It's a pleasure to be able to talk
to the people of the city of New York.</i>

14
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,756
Bullshit.

15
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,804
Hey. What did you dig up
in those cases I gave you?

16
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,641
Matthewson...

17
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,643
murder.

18
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:52,315
Out of your jurisdiction,
across the city line in Philadelphia.

19
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,318
Chergov, murder.

20
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,904
Went home yesterday.

21
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,324
Donaldson, multiple rape.

22
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,326
Has a record in the Bronx.

23
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,162
Can be extradited.

24
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,831
Get him the hell out of Manhattan.

25
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,625
What about Zolitnikoff?

26
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,501
Well, give me time, will you?

27
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,338
You've been telling me that
for the last three days.

28
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,840
Well, I can't locate the files.

29
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,843
I spent hours on it at the Exchange today.

30
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,679
Talked to every other book
who was there.

31
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,433
You know, there are 20 million guys
out of work in Manhattan alone...

32
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,686
just waiting for my job and yours too.

33
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,522
I want to close that case
and sign it out.

34
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,108
What the hell kind of miracle
do you want of me?

35
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,696
I'm just an ordinary police book,
not the Library of Congress.

36
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,532
I don't know why I bother.

37
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,161
Because it's your job.
Besides, you love me.

38
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,710
- That margarine's turned.
- Son of a bitch.

39
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,716
Zolitnikoff, no record.
Matthewson, no jurisdiction.

40
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:07,098
Chergov, home. And Donaldson, extradite.

41
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,475
Why don't you eat something?

42
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,229
- I'm not hungry enough yet.
- It's not bad.

43
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,525
Tasteless, odorless crud.

44
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,738
You don't know any better.

45
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,743
Oh, for--

46
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,747
You know, when I was a kid...

47
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,624
food was food.

48
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,130
Before our scientific magicians
poisoned the water...

49
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,676
polluted the soil,
decimated plant and animal life.

50
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,762
Why, in my day,
you could buy meat anywhere.

51
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,391
Eggs, they had. Real butter.
Fresh lettuce in the stores.

52
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,435
I know, Sol. You told me before.

53
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,104
How can anything survive
in a climate like this?

54
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,273
A heat wave all year long.

55
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,694
A greenhouse effect.
Everything is burning up.

56
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,739
Okay, wise guy.

57
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,589
Eat some Soylent Green and calm down.

58
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,259
I finished it last night.
I was hungry, damn it.

59
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,221
- I'll hustle some more on Tuesday.
- You do that.

60
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,640
I don't want to get caught in another riot.

61
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,477
Get off. I'll charge up the batteries
before I go.

62
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,981
- You'll get a heart attack.
- I should be so lucky.

63
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,234
I've pedaled this damn thing
halfway around the world.

64
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,779
You know, I'm getting pretty sick of you.

65
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,989
Yes, but you love me.

66
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:52,119
Night shift again. I'll be damn late.

67
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,122
So get something to eat.

68
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,836
- What?
- Go with God.

69
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,505
Schmuck.

70
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,860
Gilbert?

71
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,363
Hey, Mr. Donovan.

72
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,532
I have something for you.

73
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,492
Get inside.

74
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,993
Great.

75
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,638
Handmade, isn't that?

76
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,726
Do you have the words straight?

77
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,354
I won't understand them
if I live to be 100.

78
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,564
You won't.

79
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,900
Okay.

80
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,405
There!

81
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,084
It's good to hear you laugh.

82
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,420
- Come on and play.
- No, thank you.

83
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:29,175
- Thank you for the toy.
- I'm glad it amuses you.

84
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,431
Let me do something for you.

85
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,601
Are you ready, Miss Shirl?
It's getting late.

86
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,769
Go ahead.

87
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,731
According to the inventory,
we're low on everything.

88
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,610
Okay, but I'm gonna bring you a surprise.

89
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,116
I demolished five saucers with one rocket.

90
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,951
Not bad for an amateur.

91
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,539
- I've got your curfew pass.
- Oh, good. I thought I'd lost it.

92
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,848
That makes it 279 D's and 15 cents.

93
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,644
Call it 279 D's even for Mr. Simonson.

94
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,395
Sign it, Brady.

95
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,065
Mr. Brady?

96
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,902
Think I forgot? I didn't forget.

97
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,281
You asked for something special,
and I got it. Come on over here.

98
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:44,250
How often can I offer a customer
something really fantastic?

99
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,960
Look.

100
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,504
Beef, Miss Shirl.

101
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,507
Beef like you've never seen before.

102
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
What do you want?

103
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:35,110
You, Mr. Simonson.

104
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,281
I knew soon.

105
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:49,458
They told me to say
that they were sorry...

106
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,127
but that you had become unreliable.

107
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,967
That's true.

108
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,806
They can't risk a catastrophe, they say.

109
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,058
They're right.

110
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,412
Then...

111
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,023
this is right?

112
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,567
No, not right.

113
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,570
Necessary.

114
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,281
To who?

115
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,161
To God.

116
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,182
I made the routine check.
He was alive at 10:35.

117
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,309
- What was your name again?
- Charles.

118
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,354
- Charles what?
- Just Charles.

119
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,982
It's perfectly legal.

120
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,820
God, we haven't had any trouble here
in years, not years.

121
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,366
The scanners and alarms
went out of order last Thursday.

122
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,453
- Come on. Let's have a look.
- Yes, it was Thursday.

123
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,787
The problem is parts.

124
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,373
The original manufacturer's out of business.

125
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,333
Our men fabricate replacements.

126
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,503
Takes them forever, just forever.

127
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,299
Nothing works, not really.
You can't believe the problems I have.

128
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,886
I'll have to tell the other tenants.

129
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,056
What do I do? Call each of them and say
Mr. Simonson in 22A was slaughtered?

130
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,392
Unit scanner and alarm,
the best there is.

131
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,977
We should have more guards.

132
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,354
- I told management--
- Wait.

133
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,732
We should have more guards.

134
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,986
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.

135
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,407
Tab Fielding. I was Mr. Simonson's bodyguard.

136
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,035
Furniture?

137
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,245
- Yes.
- Simonson's?

138
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,749
- Personal or building?
- Building.

139
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,919
- Where's Simonson?
- In the living room.

140
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,546
Let's go.

141
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,393
- What was his full name?
- William R. Simonson.

142
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,108
Occupation?

143
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,778
- Rich.
- Rich what?

144
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,947
Lawyer. Politics.

145
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,283
I had the impression
he was more or less retired.

146
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,539
Say, does this building
have a food inventory?

147
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,957
Yes, sir.

148
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,959
Wouldn't you know?

149
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,131
Get me some booze.

150
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,968
- That's not within your jurisdiction--
- Relax.

151
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,303
You're not working for him anymore.

152
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,472
Your contract's been canceled.

153
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,058
I've been paid to the end of the month.

154
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,686
Get the bottle.

155
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,157
Your boss didn't put up much of a fight.

156
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,159
He wasn't the type.

157
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,084
- Most people like to live.
- If you say so.

158
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,003
You're a dream.

159
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,922
Bourbon! Son of a--

160
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,684
Hey. Where were you, bodyguard,
when they were butchering your boss?

161
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,853
- He sent us out shopping--
- Us?

162
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,023
The girl and I. You know, Shirl.

163
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,945
So?

164
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,533
Well, we got back at 11.
I saw the jimmy marks on the door and ran in...

165
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,368
but obviously it was--

166
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,879
You know how to write?

167
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,881
Yes.

168
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,134
Why don't you go in the foyer
and write me a statement?

169
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,055
Include all your movements
tonight and yesterday...

170
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,058
and your employment number. Okay?

171
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,809
Okay.

172
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,128
He'd be alive if we hadn't gone out.

173
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,465
Now, you have nothing to regret.
He told us to go.

174
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,301
I think he wanted to die.

175
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:38,140
It was a stupid, amateur burglar.
Nobody's fault, Shirl.

176
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,311
Honey, it wasn't anybody's fault.

177
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,313
Working on your report?

178
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,441
- I was just trying to--
- Yeah, I know.

179
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,944
Hey, what's your name? Shirl?

180
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,612
Yes.

181
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,781
Come on in here a minute, Shirl.

182
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
Come on.

183
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,662
Shut the door.

184
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,631
Let's see your hands.

185
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,306
How many times you been
in trouble with the police?

186
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,807
- Never.
- I can't hear you.

187
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,267
Never!

188
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,020
No fresh bruises.

189
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,273
He didn't knock you around, huh?
You're a lucky girl.

190
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,359
- He never hit me.
- What?

191
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,113
He was a gentle man.
He never abused me.

192
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,491
I wished he'd lived forever.

193
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,035
- Unless you were fooling around.
- No.

194
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,621
- With the bodyguard maybe?
- No, I'm straight.

195
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,414
Ask Charles. I don't cheat.

196
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,541
Come on.

197
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,044
I'd never risk my job.

198
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,963
When you came back,
did you see the body?

199
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,590
Just for a moment.

200
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,093
- Was it like it is now?
- Yes, like it is.

201
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,807
Yeah?

202
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,644
- Sanitation squad is here.
- Just a minute.

203
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,899
What's your arrangement here?

204
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,152
I stay for the next tenant,
if he wants me.

205
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,155
I may have to see you again.

206
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
All right.

207
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,037
Okay, Shirl. That's all.

208
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,763
Thorn, I thought they had you
on riot control.

209
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,098
Right, Wagner.

210
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,433
Hatcher's got you working a double shift?

211
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,768
Me and everybody else.

212
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,812
- No wonder you look lousy.
- Thanks.

213
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,858
- How do you want him marked?
- Simonson. Murder. Dispose.

214
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,611
- They're full up at waste disposal.
- So check dispatch.

215
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,488
Here. You better sign for him.

216
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,371
- My usual cut?
- You'll get your cut.

217
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,707
Just so we understand.

218
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,805
Where are they taking him?

219
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,600
- What's the difference?
- Tell me, please.

220
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,980
He'll be driven outside the city
to a waste disposal plant.

221
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,984
When my grandmother died...

222
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,403
there was a ceremony.

223
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,406
- I remember.
- I know.

224
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,492
You got your report?

225
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,416
What about the death benefit?

226
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,169
We hold it, pending next of kin.

227
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,880
There is no next of kin.

228
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,716
You can file a claim in 30 days.

229
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,509
I was thinking of Shirl.

230
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,012
Sure you were.

231
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,267
Hey, Wagner!

232
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,519
Give me a lift home?

233
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,232
Hey, Sol!

234
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,653
What are you doing home?

235
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,905
What time is it?

236
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,493
Paper.

237
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,205
- New paper.
- Have some pencils.

238
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,419
Did you ever see a cake of soap that big?

239
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:23,675
Courtesy of your next assignment,
William R. Simonson.

240
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,094
Chelsea Towers West.

241
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,516
"Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report...

242
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,644
2015 to 2019."

243
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,314
Two volumes.

244
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,778
- Where in hell did you get all these?
- Off his shelves.

245
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,698
The only reference books he had.
You like them?

246
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,491
I love them.

247
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,787
Do you know how many books
were published once upon a time?

248
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,541
When there was paper and power
and presses that worked and--

249
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,962
What the hell?

250
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
Oh, my God.

251
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,261
This Simonson was a great man.

252
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,403
Love apple.

253
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,284
Isn't that beautiful?

254
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,062
Sol.

255
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,335
Beef?

256
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,509
Oh, my God.

257
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,352
How did we come to this?

258
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,736
Why the hell don't you get out of here?
Go back to your foolish work.

259
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,031
Come on, Sol. Don't take it so big.

260
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,784
Look, we're doing okay.

261
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,619
We're doing fine.

262
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,205
We're doing lousy...

263
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,457
just like when I was a boy.

264
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,377
Nobody cares. Nobody tries...

265
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,462
including me.

266
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,425
I should have gone home long ago.

267
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,719
Come on. I need you.

268
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,766
Simonson, William R.

269
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,572
Number ACX2167D.

270
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:55,160
- 200 D's cash or 250 in food coupons?
- Cash, please.

271
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:59,080
<i>Death benefits, line up
at tables one and two.</i>

272
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:05,378
<i>Death benefits, line up
at tables one and two.</i>

273
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,174
Hey, Callahan, busy house tonight, huh?

274
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,927
So we'll double up the Tuesday riot detail
here at 62nd tomorrow.

275
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,681
That'll leave us thin up here at 101st,
so we'll back up with scoops there.

276
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,391
Got that?

277
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,033
So you finally made it.

278
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,787
- Do you know what time it is?
- You're the one with a watch.

279
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,374
I can't. The damn thing won't run.

280
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,793
Let me see it. Maybe I can fix it again.

281
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,963
Okay.

282
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,304
Oh, let's see. The Matthewson murder....

283
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,890
He's in Philadelphia, out of our jurisdiction.

284
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,558
His wife's been lying.

285
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,479
We'll pick her up if we can find her.
Here. Sign.

286
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,439
Zolitnikoff.

287
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,441
I'm working on it.

288
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,362
Which means you still
haven't got a damn thing.

289
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,076
How old is Sol Roth now?

290
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,497
He's doing all right.

291
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,998
He's had it.

292
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,043
It's time for you to get another book.

293
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,671
- I'll make arrangements.
- No.

294
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,715
- Sooner or later.
- Not now.

295
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,968
Well, it's your job.

296
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,099
Simonson.

297
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,351
Supposed to look like he was killed...

298
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,437
when he caught some punk
burglarizing his apartment.

299
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,441
- Well, what do you say?
- It was an assassination.

300
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,859
Just like that?

301
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,780
One: The alarm system was out of order
for the first time in two years.

302
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,574
Two: The bodyguard was conveniently out shopping.

303
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,287
Three: The punk didn't take anything.
And four: The punk was no punk.

304
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,291
He used a meat hook instead of a gun
to make it look like a punk.

305
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,128
- What did you take?
- Everything I could lay my hands on.

306
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,008
Well, what's for Mother?

307
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,932
One bill for me, 50 for Kulozik, 50 for you.

308
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,518
Ten for Wagner from your end.

309
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,576
- Simonson must have been big.
- How big?

310
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,996
Enough for Chelsea Towers West.

311
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,583
- Who did the inside work?
- For my money, it's the bodyguard.

312
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:54,464
- What about the furniture?
- Like grapefruit.

313
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,633
You never saw a grapefruit.

314
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,927
You never saw her.

315
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,680
Come on. Shove.

316
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,768
- You know what I really think?
- What?

317
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,270
I think it's really busted this time.

318
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:41,969
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybean!

319
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,904
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybean!

320
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,948
Hey! Watch where the hell you're stepping!

321
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,254
What may I do for you, sir?

322
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,591
Thorn, 14th Precinct.

323
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,302
We run a clean building here, Mr. Thorn.

324
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,181
- I want to see Tab Fielding.
- Second floor to the right.

325
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,412
- Who's there?
- Police.

326
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,999
Just a minute.

327
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,298
I'm not dressed!

328
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,933
Let me see your badge.

329
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,434
Open up.

330
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,102
All right.

331
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,109
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.

332
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,279
Sorry to make such a racket.
I want to see Mr. Fielding.

333
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,948
He isn't home.

334
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,952
- You Mrs. Fielding?
- I'm Martha Phillips. I live here.

335
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,539
I just met Tab yesterday
in connection with a case.

336
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,208
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask him.

337
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,253
- Would you know where he is now?
- No.

338
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,673
When will he be back?

339
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,467
I don't know. He just left.

340
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,010
Swell.

341
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,720
New furniture?

342
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,515
- I've been with him for four years.
- Furniture?

343
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,850
Yes.

344
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,687
Hey, this is really a terrific place.

345
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,482
That's rice.

346
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,568
Yeah, I've seen it before.

347
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,904
Tab does pretty well for himself, doesn't he?

348
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,324
- He's got a good reputation.
- Who with?

349
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,244
- The people he works for.
- Who's that?

350
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,162
You know, Chelsea West.

351
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,584
Yeah. Well, when he gets back,
tell him Detective Thorn was here. Okay?

352
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,002
Anything you say.

353
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,930
Come on in here a minute, will you?

354
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,515
Sure.

355
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,230
I haven't seen an incinerator for years.

356
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,860
- Used it lately?
- No, it doesn't work.

357
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,529
What does?

358
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,535
Really a nice place you got here.
Really nice.

359
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,206
Plenty of room to move around.

360
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,541
Yeah.

361
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,336
We were very lucky to get it.

362
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,423
Sorry I had to bust in like this.
You know? Just routine.

363
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,135
- I haven't been very nice.
- You're just fine.

364
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,388
I should have offered you something, Mr. Thorn.

365
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,769
If I'd had the time,
I would've asked for it.

366
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,367
Son of a bitch.

367
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,462
I haven't eaten like this in years.

368
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,048
I never ate like this.

369
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,383
And now you know what you've been missing.

370
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,720
- There was a world once, you punk.
- Yes. So you keep telling me.

371
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,722
I was there. I can prove it.

372
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,353
I know. I know.

373
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:50,564
When you were young,
people were better.

374
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,902
Oh, nuts. People were always rotten.

375
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,738
But the world was beautiful.

376
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,368
It's late.

377
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,246
I gotta get to work.

378
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,665
What have you dug up on Simonson?

379
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,584
I've got a handful of reference work
20 years out of date.

380
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,254
You throw out a name
and you expect a miracle.

381
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,549
Simonson, Sol. Report, huh?

382
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,925
Schmuck.

383
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:24,265
Biographical survey, 2006.
Last one they published.

384
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,936
Simonson, William R.

385
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,439
Born 1954.

386
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,900
Evidently unmarried.

387
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,445
Graduated Yale Law School in 1977.

388
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:43,409
Principal partner, Simonson,
Borden and Santini.

389
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:47,663
- Governor Santini?
- Hold still. There's more.

390
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:54,920
In 1997, he was the director of
Holcox Manufacturing, Norfolk, Virginia.

391
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,716
Specialist in manufacturing
freeze-drying equipment...

392
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,093
for commercial food processing.

393
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,473
And in 2018...

394
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,809
Holcox was acquired by Soylent...

395
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,478
and Simonson became a member of the board.

396
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,939
The board of Soylent?

397
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,443
Your dead one was a very important man.

398
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,487
Soylent controls the food supply
for half the world.

399
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,825
- What about those?
- Oh, very technical and highly classified.

400
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,162
Unnumbered copies.
Officially, they don't exist.

401
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,580
Perfect.

402
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,624
- What else do you want?
- Everything.

403
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:36,962
Well, law, Soylent, oceanography--?

404
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,756
Across the board.

405
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,633
Across--? Oh, that's impossible.

406
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,344
Check the Exchange.

407
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,349
Check the Exchange.
I need you to tell me that?

408
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,311
You know, I was a teacher once,
a full professor, a respected man.

409
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:56,982
Make a special effort, will you, Sol?
This case is for real, for a lot of marbles.

410
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,817
- For who?
- Never mind.

411
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:03,822
- Don't forget to pick up the water ration.
- I'll do that. I'll die if I don't get water.

412
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,282
Hey.

413
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,453
- Taste that.
- Taste what?

414
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,622
Taste it.

415
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,672
Strawberries?

416
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,009
Hundred and fifty bucks a jar of strawberries.

417
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,561
Thorn.

418
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:20,566
ID is RC105.

419
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,402
Get me the 14th Precinct.

420
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,698
Thorn, how about paying us a visit?

421
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,451
I can't. I'm following up the Simonson thing.

422
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,830
- Well, what have you got?
- He was a director of Soylent.

423
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,251
- What else?
- Well, right now, somebody's tailing me.

424
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,836
He's damn good at it.

425
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,713
Big deal.

426
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,136
Would you believe bodyguards
are buying strawberries for 150 D's a jar?

427
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,306
You'd better report in here right away.

428
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,601
Yes, sir, first thing in the morning.

429
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,272
That was Thorn.

430
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,774
He's a damn good cop.

431
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,942
Appreciate the difficulty, Ed.

432
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,322
But the department wants to cooperate
with the governor's office, right?

433
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,949
Whatever you say, sir.

434
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,334
It looks like a fair-complected man...

435
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,961
maybe someone close to you, a protector.

436
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,423
And if we refer back
to this card back here...

437
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:30,511
if you look at it, the time sequence
indicates a three-month period.

438
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,639
The cards indicate a secure trend
should follow shortly.

439
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,683
So things are looking up a bit, Kathy.

440
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,499
Thank you.

441
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,629
- Your hair looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

442
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,850
Who is it?

443
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,936
Thorn. Detective Thorn.

444
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,860
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask.

445
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,868
Having a party?

446
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,453
Just my friends.

447
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,250
It's okay.

448
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,712
Ice.

449
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,256
Jeez.

450
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,717
That's great.

451
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:04,563
It's still over 90 out there.

452
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,987
Hey.

453
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,749
You know, if I had the money,
I'd smoke two, three of these every day.

454
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,754
Come on in here.

455
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,770
On the bed.

456
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:53,111
This is a nice place,
the way it's fixed up.

457
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,032
Perfume.

458
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,828
He was murdered, you know. Assassinated.

459
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,665
Robbery had nothing to do with it.

460
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,793
You understand?

461
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,962
Yes.

462
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,007
- Did he have any relatives?
- I never heard of any.

463
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,802
- Do you know who he worked for?
- No.

464
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,973
- You were with him for three years.
- He never talked about his work.

465
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,267
Did you meet his friends?

466
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,852
Sure, I met some of his friends.

467
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,521
What were their names?

468
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:31,858
- I was never really introduced, you know.
- Oh, come on, Shirl.

469
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,321
Well, there was a Mr. Lempeter...

470
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,491
a man called Tompkins...

471
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,202
and somebody called Santini.

472
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,039
That's all I remember.

473
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,209
He didn't bring people up here very often.

474
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,172
Santini's the governor.

475
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,508
So?

476
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,595
Where did you go with Simonson?

477
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,683
No place.

478
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,104
Shopping once in a while.

479
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,315
- Except--
- Except?

480
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,317
He took me to church.

481
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,901
Church?

482
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,114
About a month ago, and then again
a few days before he died.

483
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,200
What did he do there?

484
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,578
He prayed.

485
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,581
And he talked to a priest.

486
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:28,915
That's about all.

487
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,085
- Why would he take you to church?
- He didn't say.

488
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,546
Why do you think?

489
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:38,216
I think he just wanted
to have somebody along.

490
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,845
He was very strange towards the end.

491
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,058
He didn't touch me for months.

492
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:51,271
And sometimes for no reason at all,
he'd start to cry.

493
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,648
I saw him cry more than once.

494
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,861
Old people do that.

495
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,654
Do they?

496
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,784
I can't figure this Simonson.

497
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:09,915
If I was like him, rich, important...

498
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,751
plenty to eat...

499
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,462
real bourbon...

500
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,172
and a girl like you...

501
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,926
you wouldn't see me in church.

502
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,971
What are you doing here?

503
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:28,892
I've been looking all over the building for you.
I'll teach you to break my rules!

504
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,437
Furniture stays in units!

505
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,607
I've told you before.

506
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,777
- No!
- I mean it!

507
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,321
- I'll get rid of the whole--
- Hold it!

508
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,830
I didn't know you were here, Mr. Thorn.

509
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,962
We give them a day off a month.
We don't have to.

510
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,215
And they break every regulation in the book.

511
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,768
You'd think they'd be grateful for
what they've got here. Wouldn't you?

512
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,356
I'll tell you, Charlie...

513
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,526
they're here because
I called them for questioning.

514
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:23,864
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

515
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,867
Don't you believe me, Charlie?

516
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,371
You should have told me.

517
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,373
Why?

518
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,834
Regulations.

519
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,045
You wanna file a complaint?

520
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,343
What do you say, Charlie?

521
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,181
No.

522
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:54,060
I don't want to do anything unfriendly
like that, Mr. Thorn.

523
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:00,025
I wonder if any of these girls
want to file a complaint against you.

524
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,279
Maybe not.

525
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,532
Maybe they want to keep it friendly.

526
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,076
I hope so.

527
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,787
Don't you, Charlie?

528
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,917
Don't you?

529
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,211
Yes.

530
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,087
Get the hell out of here.

531
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,688
Look, maybe we better all go.
Come on.

532
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,273
Come on.

533
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,817
Come on, baby.

534
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,254
Charles isn't as bad as some.

535
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,130
Don't you ever get mad?

536
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,424
What for?

537
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,643
I left my stuff in here.

538
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,104
It's still dark.

539
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,815
You could stay a while.

540
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,150
You could wash up.

541
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,819
I'll make you breakfast.

542
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,280
Why should you?

543
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,449
There's plenty of food in the refrigerator.

544
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,370
Charles wouldn't dare make trouble
for you now.

545
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,667
I got work.

546
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,629
I don't wanna be alone.

547
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,009
I'm frightened when I'm alone.

548
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,804
There's nothing I can do for you, furniture.

549
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,806
I got nothing to give.

550
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,517
The new tenant is coming
to look over the place.

551
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,102
He may not want me.

552
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:04,441
Well, I got a place,
but it's nothing like this.

553
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,654
This is like my home.

554
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,825
I've been here a long time.

555
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,706
You could take a shower
and let the water run as long as you like.

556
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,508
You got....

557
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,553
You got hot water here.

558
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,805
Very hot.

559
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,017
Jeez!

560
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,521
I haven't had a hot bath....

561
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,566
I'll rub you down afterwards.

562
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:54,366
All right.

563
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,910
You turn that air conditioner on
all the way.

564
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,747
All the way up. We'll make it cold,
like winter used to be.

565
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,584
- What about breakfast?
- Anything you like.

566
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,544
- Strawberries.
- An egg.

567
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,381
- No, strawberries.
- I've never seen strawberries.

568
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,677
All right. An egg then.
Who the hell needs strawberries?

569
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,560
Mommy! Mommy!

570
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:11,609
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

571
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,405
- Hey, Sister.
- Mommy!

572
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,658
Mommy! Mommy!

573
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:23,121
- Where's the priest?
- You'll find him over there.

574
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,366
Thorn, Father, 14th Precinct.

575
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,870
My name is Paul.

576
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:07,707
Have I done something?

577
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:12,086
No, I'm investigating the murder
of Mr. William Simonson.

578
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,215
- Who do you say?
- Simonson.

579
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,843
Quite an important man, a rich man.

580
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,845
I have no recollection.

581
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,722
- You talked to him.
- Did I?

582
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,225
No doubt about it.

583
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,230
A rich man.

584
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,107
Yes, I remember.

585
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,570
We don't see rich people here anymore.

586
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:41,115
There isn't even enough room for the poor.

587
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,618
There's just too many.

588
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,411
Far too many.

589
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,831
- Fa--
- My memory's eroded.

590
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:53,878
Chiefly, I assign space to people
who need space.

591
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,257
Do you need some space?

592
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,260
I need to know what he said to you.

593
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,928
- Are you sure he's dead?
- Yes.

594
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,429
- Really dead?
- He's dead.

595
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,725
- What did he talk to you about?
- Come back tomorrow. I'm very tired.

596
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,769
Father.

597
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,438
Father, did you hear his confession?

598
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:16,609
There should be a requiem mass,
but there's no room.

599
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,696
- Should I make room?
- This is very important.

600
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,906
I can't help you.

601
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,660
Forgive me. It's destroying me.

602
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,788
- What is?
- The truth.

603
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,124
The truth Simonson told you?

604
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,293
- All truth.
- What is it?

605
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,630
What did he confess?

606
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,053
Sweet Jesus.

607
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,909
- We're closing the Simonson case.
- The hell you say.

608
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:11,331
You heard me. The Simonson case is officially closed.
Felonious assault. Sign.

609
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,584
Yesterday you agreed it was assassination.

610
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,922
There's been 137 reported murders since then,
and we won't solve them either.

611
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,007
I'm not gonna falsify that report.

612
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,093
Got a suspect?

613
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,345
I've got leads.

614
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,849
This isn't somebody you scratch
after 24 hours and forget.

615
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:33,186
I told you there's been a tail on me.

616
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,313
Something stinks here.

617
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:40,318
- Look, you'll sign this, and I'll bury it.
- Like hell you will.

618
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,113
A member of the board of the Soylent Corporation...

619
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,199
was torn apart with a meat hook!

620
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,535
You can't sweep that carcass under the rug.
Who bought you?

621
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,621
You're bought when they pay you a salary.

622
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,872
Who's they?

623
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,709
High and hot. They want this case
closed permanently! Sign this!

624
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:57,961
You sign it!

625
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,881
If I close and somebody higher and hotter
wants to know why, it's my job!

626
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,549
Sign it. I'll cover for you.

627
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:08,554
I won't put my job on the line for you, Hatcher.
Not my damn job!

628
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,312
Hey, big shot.

629
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,982
Hatcher says you're on riot control.

630
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,568
Great. That really makes my day.

631
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,739
This was once called Gramercy Park.

632
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,867
Now it's the only tree sanctuary
in New York.

633
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,996
Governor. Sorry to disturb you this way, sir.

634
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,081
Not at all, Donovan. Not at all.

635
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,167
Your secretary told me where to find you.
It's urgent...

636
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:42,422
- or I wouldn't have come out here.
- I understand.

637
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,925
Now, what is it?

638
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,012
I'm to inform you the board
is determined to resolve...

639
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,681
the Simonson investigation immediately, sir.

640
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,017
- I thought it was resolved.
- Yes, sir.

641
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,770
But the police officer involved
refuses to close the case.

642
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,190
Perhaps because he went to church yesterday.

643
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,485
- What does that mean?
- It was Simonson's church.

644
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,613
The cop spoke 20 minutes with the priest.

645
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,532
So?

646
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,452
The same priest who heard Simonson's confession.

647
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,787
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

648
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,790
I can't hear any more about it.

649
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,209
Just do what you have to do.

650
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,073
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

651
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,077
It has been six months
since my last confession.

652
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,097
A real bargain, folks. Synthetic footgear.

653
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,349
Plastics. Plastic ware.

654
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,268
We have a large assortment of plastic ware.

655
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,438
Some are a little chipped.
Others have hardly any cracks.

656
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:27,401
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybeans.

657
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:34,283
Soylent crumbs! Two D's a kilo.
Nothing cheaper in the market. Come and get it.

658
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:37,620
Soylent buns!
Get your genuine Soylent buns!

659
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:45,503
Keep moving right along.
Soylent Green. Soylent Green right here.

660
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,053
They gave me a quarter of a kilo.

661
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:59,058
I stood in line the whole lousy day,
and they gave me a quarter of a kilo!

662
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,561
Do you believe that?

663
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:06,524
Let me go! Are you gonna put up with this?

664
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,506
They're running out of the damn green.

665
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,343
- Idiots.
- Some foul-up at transport.

666
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:37,096
- This crowd will blow.
- I know.

667
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:41,017
Got the scoops standing by,
but I don't know if they can handle this.

668
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,436
When you gonna make the announcement?

669
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,813
As soon as I get up the nerve.

670
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,441
About five minutes, I guess.
Better pass the word.

671
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,443
Right.

672
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,284
This is the police.

673
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,870
This is the police. This is the police.

674
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,125
I am asking you to disperse.

675
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,503
The supply of Soylent Green
has been exhausted.

676
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,507
You must evacuate the area.

677
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,718
The scoops are on their way.

678
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,304
The scoops are on their way!

679
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:22,350
I repeat: The scoops are on their way.

680
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,810
Today is Tuesday!

681
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,773
Why would you leave that door open?

682
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,072
Mr. Fielding.

683
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,702
- Why did you set up Simonson?
- I didn't.

684
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,372
You're all there is.

685
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,044
- Who pays your bills?
- I do.

686
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:47,346
Oh, no. I won't hit a cop. Bastard.

687
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,515
Yeah, I know.

688
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,123
You get life for that, jerk!

689
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:18,919
Life in a waste disposal plant
in a Soylent factory someplace.

690
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,473
How about that big, fat Soylent Corporation?

691
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,726
Do you work for them like Simonson did?

692
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,103
How much did they pay you for that one?

693
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,355
Does Soylent buy your strawberries?

694
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,984
Anybody tails me, bothers me one more time...

695
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:46,655
I'll come back here and kill you both.
Got it?

696
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,117
Get off my back!

697
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,794
Thorn.

698
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,506
I was worried about you.

699
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,259
- What happened?
- Never mind.

700
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:11,680
It doesn't matter.

701
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:46,674
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.
- Good evening.

702
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,925
Thank you.

703
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,900
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.

704
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,986
- Mr. Roth.
- Evening.

705
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,529
Good evening, Your Honor.

706
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:11,740
I assume you have a priority police problem.

707
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:16,370
Yes, Your Honor.
It's about William Simonson.

708
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,747
And...

709
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,166
these.

710
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,765
Thorn.

711
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:40,603
Thorn. It's curfew.

712
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,898
How do you feel?

713
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,943
A lot better.

714
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,612
I did the best I could...

715
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,698
but I still think you should go see
the police doctor.

716
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,075
He might relieve me from duty.

717
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,036
You need a rest.

718
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,039
More than two days, and I lose my job.

719
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,083
- We could go to another city.
- What for?

720
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,210
They're all like this.

721
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,630
- The country?
- That's not allowed.

722
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,466
Those farms are like fortresses.

723
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,052
- Why?
- Good land's gotta be guarded...

724
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,721
the way they guard
the waste disposal plants...

725
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,058
and Soylent factories and the plankton ships.

726
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:23,562
You know, there are idiots in this world
who wanna take everything we've got.

727
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,776
- Maybe Simonson was one of them.
- I don't believe it.

728
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,280
It means there's no place for us to go.

729
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,449
That's right.

730
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,743
Why should we?

731
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,500
You be careful now.

732
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,502
Keep the scanners on.

733
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,088
Don't go anyplace without a bodyguard.

734
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,091
The new tenant comes tonight.

735
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,760
He'll like you.

736
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:59,264
You're a hell of a piece of furniture.

737
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,267
Don't talk to me like that.

738
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,563
Please.

739
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,775
Okay.

740
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,990
It's horrible.

741
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,868
You must accept it.

742
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,372
I see the words, but I can't believe them.

743
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,083
Believe.

744
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:29,169
The evidence is overwhelming.

745
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,508
- Simonson was a member of the board.
- Yeah.

746
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:39,847
He learned these facts,
and they shook his sanity.

747
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,725
The corporation knew...

748
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:47,062
he was not reliable anymore.

749
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,315
They feared he might talk...

750
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,901
and so he was eliminated.

751
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:58,532
- Then why are they doing this?
- Because it's easier.

752
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,911
I think "expedient" is the word.

753
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:08,625
What we need is the proof
of what they are doing...

754
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,379
before we bring it
to the Council of Nations.

755
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,550
Good God.

756
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,762
What God, Mr. Roth?

757
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,891
Where will we find him?

758
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,227
Perhaps at home.

759
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,692
Yes, at home.

760
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:54,880
I waited two whole damn years for an apartment
to open up in this building.

761
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,216
It's a nice place.

762
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:06,433
- How long have you been here?
- A long time.

763
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,937
How old are you?

764
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,730
Twenty-one.

765
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,942
Charles said you were 24.

766
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,693
That makes us both liars.

767
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,408
All right.

768
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,617
All right.

769
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:27,496
I sleep late.
I like a big breakfast and no lunch.

770
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,289
I'll organize the dinner menu.

771
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,583
Three or four times a week,
I have guests.

772
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,837
Sometimes it's business,
and then we have to be alone.

773
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:39,424
Sometimes it's fun,
and then we like a girl who's fun.

774
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,719
Are you fun?

775
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,366
May I help you, sir?

776
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:12,291
- It feels good.
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?

777
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,839
And your favorite color?

778
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,008
Orange, I guess.

779
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,218
- Music?
- Classical.

780
01:11:05,986 --> 01:11:10,182
- Light classical.
- I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

781
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,104
Sign here, please, Mr. Roth.

782
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:21,360
- A full 20 minutes?
- Oh, certainly. Guaranteed.

783
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,615
Thank you.

784
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,912
This way, please, Mr. Roth.

785
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,541
Good evening, ma'am.
May I have your name, please?

786
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,129
Well, I see that orange
is your favorite color.

787
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,634
- You want Mr. Solomon Roth?
- That's right.

788
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,970
This way, please.

789
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,329
My God.

790
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:41,249
It's truly unfortunate
that you missed the overture.

791
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:58,100
- I want to see him.
- That is prohibited during the ceremony.

792
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,559
Well, I can assure you--

793
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:02,062
Open that damn thing right now...

794
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,606
or I swear to God
you'll die before he does.

795
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,068
All right! All right.

796
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,661
Sol, can you hear me?

797
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,041
- <i>Thorn?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

798
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,792
Thank you for coming.

799
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,839
- <i>Oh, dear God.</i>
- I've lived too long.

800
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,675
<i>No.</i>

801
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,595
I love you, Thorn.

802
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:04,309
I love you, Sol.

803
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,113
Can you see it?

804
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:20,659
Yes.

805
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,204
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

806
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,249
Oh, yes.

807
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,840
I told you.

How could I?

810
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,268
How could I ever imagine?

811
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,384
Horrible.

812
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,305
Simonson.

813
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,392
Soylent.

814
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,981
Listen to me, Thorn.

815
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,733
Thorn, listen.

816
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,824
I can't hear him.

817
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,410
Do something, damn it!

818
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,584
Yes, Sol.

819
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:07,307
<i>You've got to prove it, Thorn.</i>

820
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,977
<i>Go to the Exchange.</i>

821
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,605
<i>Please, Thorn.</i>

822
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,861
You've got to prove it, Thorn.

823
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,489
The Exchange.

824
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,240
Go to....

825
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,412
Hey!

826
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:25,865
- <i>Dispatch.</i>
- Thorn, ID RC105.

827
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,492
Get me the 14th Precinct. Urgent.

828
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,578
<i>Just a moment.</i>

829
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:33,748
- <i>The circuit is in use.</i>
- Well, break in!

830
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:36,792
<i>It's a 6-1 priority.</i>

831
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:41,672
Look, get me Chelsea Towers West.
Apartment 22A.

832
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,675
- Cut in if you get the 14th.
- <i>Understood.</i>

833
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,185
- Hello?
- Shirl, it's me.

834
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,772
Oh, Thorn, I'm so glad.
I have to talk to you.

835
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,358
No, there's no time.

836
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,195
- The new tenant wanted me.
- Good. Stay with him.

837
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,530
I want you to stay with him always.

838
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,908
Oh, Thorn, I want to live with you.

839
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,160
Just live.

840
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:13,621
- <i>I have Lt. Hatcher.</i>
- Plug him in.

841
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,289
Thorn?

842
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,707
Thorn.

843
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:21,045
- Thorn, where the hell have you been?
- <i>I'm at the Exchange.</i>

844
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,633
Hatcher, help me.

845
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,487
There's another one over there.

846
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:04,787
- Hey, punk, are you with us?
- Hatcher.

847
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:09,333
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, you got him, all right.

848
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:12,503
You don't listen too good,
but you're a damn good cop.

849
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,296
Hatcher...

850
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:18,509
get to the Exchange.

851
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,470
You gotta tell them they're right.

852
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,515
But let's take care of you first.

853
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:29,103
You don't understand.

854
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,188
I've got proof.

855
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:33,816
They need proof.

856
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,361
I've seen it. I've seen it happening.

857
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,364
They've gotta tell people.

858
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:46,870
- Tell them what?
- The ocean's dying. Plankton's dying.

859
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:50,249
It's people.

860
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:56,672
Soylent Green is made out of people.

861
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,649
They're making our food out of people.

862
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:19,903
Next thing, they'll be breeding us
like cattle for food.

863
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,656
You've gotta tell them.
You've gotta tell them.

864
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,534
I promise, tiger. I promise.
I'll tell the Exchange.

865
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,536
You tell everybody.

866
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:30,581
Listen to me, Hatcher.
You've gotta tell them!

867
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:34,209
Soylent Green is people!

868
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:38,339
We've gotta stop them somehow!

But the Slavers are producing
a good grade epoxy these days.

Cost you a handful of dirt

- What are you doing here?
- Just waiting.

Haven't seen you.

- Well, I owe you, then.

No, thanks. I got all the supplies I need.

You'll never make it with your sails down.

Do you want keep these hair?
Take small hydro. Small cup hydro.

56

Go on, hit the swell.

57

He does have a bush on him.

76
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,711
You know me?

77
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,548
- I know what you are.
- Good.

78
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,176
Then you know
if you look for trouble here,

79
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:25,597
you'll find more than you can handle.
You've got two hours.

80
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,186
I'll only need one.

81

- Me!
- You each get one

(Man) Look at that.

85

- Pure dirt.
- (Gasps)

86
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,971
3.2 kilos.

87
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,643
How d'you come by so much of it?

88
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,022
Another atoll 30 horizons west of here.

89
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,859
- Where'd they get it?
- They didn't say.

90
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:22,946
(Man) We heard about that place.
Heard they was all killed.

91
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,159
- That's why they didn't say.
- Smokers?

92
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,496
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

93
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,708
So what's it worth? We trading or not?

94
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,044

97
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,934
- I want twice that.
- (People gasp)

98
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,274
You drive a hard bargain.

99
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,795
Dirt?

100
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,341
I have never seen purer.

101
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:29,555
- I just want one sip of hydro.
- No, not till you tell me.

102
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,975
She's got inkings on her back. I seen her.

103
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,645
They say if you read the marks
on the child,

104
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,731
they'll lead you all the way to Dryland.

105
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,860
- Dryland's a myth.
- Aw, some still believe.

106
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,196
They say the Smokers even got
an eye out for her.

107
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,076
Well, then,
we better keep it to ourselves.

108
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,112
- Help you?
- Yeah.

109
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,032
- Where's the store?
- You found it.

110
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,123
You don't have much.

111
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,168
You the man with the dirt?

112
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,924
I'll take the hydro. All six Gs.

113
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,973
Got any canvas? Line?

114
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,102
I've got line. It's hair. No canvas.

115
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,313

116

- Nope.

00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,402
- Wood?
- No.

118
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,865
Magazines?

119
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,117
If I had a magazine,

120
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,578
I'd retire.

121
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,966
Something to drink?

122
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,135
A cup of hydro.

123
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,148
Pure.

124
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,877
<i>Skol.</i>

125
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,092
- One more.
- Make it two.

126
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,804
A man this rich will buy
for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

127
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,306
One.

128
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,146
That's an interesting pair of boots
you've got.

129
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,857
- Trade?
- No.

130
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,651
So how long you been out there, man?

131
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,783
Don't hurt asking. Talking costs nothing.

132
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:48,629
- Depends. What lunar is it?
- Well, let's see.

133
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,965
April, March, June. It's August.

134
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,635
- This August?
- Yep.

135
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,054
So how long?

136
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,434
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen lunars?

137
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,067
(Whispers) That's her.

138
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,653
Enola, hey, what are you doing?

139
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,864
- No, you can't have that.
- I need another piece to draw some more.

140
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,243
I'll get it. I'll give it to you.
Just stay in the back.

141
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,123
With all those chits,
you could order up a bath.

142
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,877
- Why are you talking to me?
- Just being friendly.

143
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,843
- Is that a tomato plant?
- Yeah.

144
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:41,264
- You have a keen eye.
- I saw one in a picture. How much?

145
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,439
Half your chits.

146
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:05,205
- I'll take them, too.
- Take what? You bought everything.

147
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,207
I'll take them shelves.

148
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,296
So, what did you see out there
in your 15 months?

149
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,716
- Such as?
- An end to all this water.

150
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,135
You're asking the wrong person.

151
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,430
- The one they buried today.
- Uh-huh?

152
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,765
She found the only end there is.

153
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,106
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.

154
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,108
I'm not bargaining. I'm leaving.

155
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,236
But you haven't even heard anything yet.
Or seen it.

156
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:45,662
You may have noticed us burying a citizen
today. That makes room for one more.

157
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,458
I'm not staying.

158
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,544
Oh, we're not asking you to.
All we want is your seed.

159
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,715
(Man) We can look to our own
for impregnation,

160
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,803
but too much of that sort of thing gets...
undesirable.

161
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:07,017
When she's pregnant, you go on your way
with all the supplies you need.

162
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,229
You don't have anything. You're dying.

163
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:20,489
No man stays out that long
and turns down a woman.

164
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,658
He's hiding something.

165
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,077
Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

166
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,539
(Whistles)

167
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:40,801
When the Elders say so, you can leave.
And not before.

168
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,696
Ah. Gills.

169
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,868
- Mutation!
- He's a Muto!

170
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,206
(Grunting)

171
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,585
Aaargh!

172
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,257
(Man) Get him!

173
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,264
(Man) Throw the nets!

174
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,993
(Yelling)

175
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,124
(Man) He's a murderer!

176
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,129
Aargh!

177
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,757
By what right?

178
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,344
You pay me to keep the peace.

179
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,974
- This isn't it.
- No! He has killed one of us.

180
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,727
- He was defending himself.
- He needs to be destroyed!

181
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,854
- Kill him!
- That may be.

182
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,941
- Kill him!
- But not here, and not like this.

183
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,737
(Metal gears turning)

184
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,683
(Boy) What is it?

185
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,769
Hey!

186
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:00,148
(Man) Too tight! I can't get it off.

187
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,195
(Man) Open the gate!

188
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,867
(Chuckling)

189
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,217
(People arguing)

190
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,844
(Man) Order!

191
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,555
This is another device we found
on the boat.

192
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:36,977
A garrote cord for strangulation!

193
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,523
We, we don't know what this is all about,

194
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:46,611
but we believe it to be
some sort of torturing device!

195
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,658
And this - this is a spy tool!

196
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,537
For listening to the unsuspecting!

197
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,084
The evidence speaks for itself.

198
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:06,548
I move that we dispense with the Muto
as soon as possible and...

199
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,133
(Helen) Why?

200
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,220
Why not use him?

201
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:16,558
Because he is a threat to the safety
and the purity of this atoll.

202
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:19,853
- He is not a threat. He's in a cage.
- He killed one of ours, Helen.

203
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,397
(Shouts of agreement)

204
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:26,693
- Is he dangerous or not?
- I'd say he is now.

205
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,321
But he came in here with all this dirt,

206
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,533
the likes of which we haven't seen
since Enola came.

207
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,327
Oh, what about it?

208
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,372
So it had to come from somewhere.

209
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:44,627
- What if it came from Dryland?
- Ah, don't start!

210
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,796
He came from the west, I can tell you.

211
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:50,008
Smokers come from there, from the west.

212
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,635
But if he is a spy,

213
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:57,265
this ichthy man will give away
our position, our weaknesses.

214
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,850
And if he isn't?

215
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:03,063
He is still a Muto and he could
contaminate our community!

216
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,982
- And others!
- What others?

217
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,610
We haven't seen another atoll
in over a year.

218
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:13,156
- Let's keep to the issue at hand.
- No, this is the issue at hand.

219
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:16,242
Every year, every month, it gets worse.

220
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:20,080
There are fewer atollers, fewer traders.

221
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,248
Dead gardens,

222
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,251
these windmills that don't work.

223
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,338
Desalinators that can't be fixed.

224
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,257
This place,

225
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:34,552
this whole way of living, it's ending.

226
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:39,516
- Doesn't anyone else see that?
- When I was a boy, we had lots of atolls.

227
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:44,437
You keep on praying for help and now
one man comes here who might actually...

228
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:48,566
- He's not a man!
- It doesn't matter what he is!

229
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,239
I say, if he knows the way to Dryland,
make him show us where it is!

230
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,408
People have looked for centuries
and death is all they found.

231
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,370
- At least they died trying!
- It's a hoax!

232
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:05,083
The sooner you realize that, Helen,
the better off we're all going to be!

233
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:09,129
We'd be better off if we got rid
of that girl of hers, too.

234
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,880
(Man) Right!

235
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:14,676
Smokers are looking for her!
I heard it from a trader.

236
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:19,597
- (Bangs gavel)
- One matter at a time!

237
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:22,392
I say get rid of both of them!

238
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,645
- The Muto and the girl!
- Yes!

239
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,899
- (Clamor)
- Yes! Kill them!

240
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,442
Order!

241
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,242
(Humming)

242
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,252
(Footsteps approach)

243
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,423
(Sniggering)

244
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,550
You'd like this, wouldn't you?

245
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:59,137
- Stick him.
- He sure is quieter than he was.

246
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:02,807
- Come on, let's go.
- No! Stick him again.

247
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:07,604
I know you want it. I know -
maybe he don't eat his own kind.

248
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:08,897
Aaaargh!

249
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,125
(Gregor) Aha! That's it!

250
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,048
A-ha-ha! That's it!
Don't move, my dear!

251
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:39,010
Polaris to Taurus.
I forgot Taurus, the bull.

252
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,554
In the shoulder of the bull

253
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,807
there's six sisters.
Or seven, but you can only see six.

254
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:49,479
At the beginning of each lunar,
one sister is lined up with Scorpius!

255
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:54,817
And Scorpius has a tail just like an arrow
on the circle on the back of the child!

256
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:59,197
If I take into account the seventh sister,
and give the seventh sister a lunar,

257
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,659
that lunar would run perpendicular
to Scorpius,

258
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,703
creating a horizon, a straight line,

259
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,332
that would run directly...
directly toward...

260
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,585
Dryland?

261
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:15,505
No.

262
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,635
(Screams) Is it a map?

263
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,638
Is it calendar?

264
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,061
Is it symbols? Is it language?

265
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,773
- You'd tell me if you knew, eh, Enola?
- Mm-hm.

266
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,196
- What are you drawing?
- I don't know.

267
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:45,952
Helen, look. Look at
the prodigal child's latest vision.

268
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,623
(He chuckles)

269
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,085
We've got to get out of here.

270
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:59,590
- I take it the meeting didn't go well.
- They're cutting us adrift, Gregor.

271
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,594
No, they'll not hurt you.
I'd turn their lights off if they did.

272
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,556
How soon before we can go?

273
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,891
Another week, ideally.

274
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,019
We don't have a week.

275
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:15,064
Helen, I don't have any idea yet
where we can go.

276
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,192
Try. Try it once again.

277
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,156
There's nothing in them.
I've been through the books.

278
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:28,786
There's nothing in these books.
She is the annunciation. I know it.

279
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,913
I just don't know how.

280
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,753
I'm a stupid man.
The answer's right there. It's...

281
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,880
It's just beyond me.

282
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,885
Maybe he knows.

283
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,232
Ah, yes, I see.

284
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,193
They are webbed.

285
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:04,614
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.

286
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:08,743
They tell me, too, that you have gills.
Isotropic gills.

287
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,120
Are they merely vestigial or functional?

288
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:16,167
My name is Gregor. I've just come
to pay you a little vi...vi...

289
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,670
Oh, my God.

290
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,801
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited.

291
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:29,514
Your gills, they are functional. Ichthys
sapien. You can breathe in the water.

292
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,933
How deep can you go?

293
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:37,188
Look, I'm only here because I want
to learn more about you.

294
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,898
(Mariner spits)

295
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,446
You don't like humans very much, do you?

296
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,116
I can't say that I blame you.

297
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:51,536
But, tell me, are all of your kind
as bad-tempered as you?

298
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,000
- I have no kind.
- Oh, fish rot.

299
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:02,839
I'd be surprised if there weren't others.
If there aren't, there will be eventually.

300
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:08,886
Anyway, I come here
because I need to ask you a question.

301
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:13,724
Where... Where did your dirt come from?
Is it from Dryland?

302
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:17,061
Do you know what this is?

303
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,900
The Ancients, they did something terrible,
didn't they? To cause all this water.

304
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:27,280
- Hundreds, hundreds of years ago.
- If I tell you, will you open this lock?

305
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,869
I haven't a key.

306
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,539
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

307
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:39,667
- As good as any key.
- A mooring cleat?

308
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,505
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

309
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,093
- I'll be right back.
- (Man) Gregor!

310
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:53,764
- What's your business there? Move along!
- I'm not a brave man.

311
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,727
If you know anything about Dryland,
please, tell me.

312
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,980
Please. Don't let it die with you.

313
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,690
No, no, no.

314
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:03,983
Stop!

315
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,818
(Man) Gregor?

316
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,778
Move along!

317
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,794
(Smokers howl like wolves)

318
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,762
(Bell tolls)

319
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,383
- Get out of the way!
- Oh!

320
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:21,102
(Elder) After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

321
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:27,066
it is our decision that this Muto
does indeed constitute a threat.

322
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:31,320
Therefore,
in the interest of public safety,

323
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:34,657
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled

324
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,243
in the customary fashion.

325
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:38,661
Proceed.

326
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,631
I'm sorry.

327
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:02,393
Bones to berries, veins to vines,

328
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:07,898
these tendons to trees,
this blood to brine.

329
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,610
Too strange for life he was,

330
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:15,156
this Muto now does leave us,

331
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,533
recycled and entombed,

332
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:21,579
in the presence of him who leads us...

333
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,341
Smokers!

334
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,052
Dead out of the sun!

335
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,224
To your posts!

336
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,365
(Alarmed yelling)

337
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,575
(Woman) Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

338
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,758
Kill!

339
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,385
There!

340
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,553
Aaah! Aaah!

341
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,311
Get to your posts!

342
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,439
We are safe, behind this wall!

343
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:33,734
Aren't we?

344
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,912
Let me out! Let me out! I'll fight!

345
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,632
Get those bullets loaded!

346
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:08,561
- I can't find my dad.
- He's probably on the wall.

347
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,897
Go in, get a weapon and fight! Go now! Go!
Go, go!

348
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,250
Give me the key to the city now.

349
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,339
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

350
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:42,970
Floor it! Floor it! Go on!

351
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,738
(Woman screaming)

352
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,577
Swab it! Swab it!

353
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,331
Hurry them up!

354
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:40,528
Burn down the door!

355
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,033
Burn it down!

356
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,409
Aargh!

357
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,967
We'll have this atoll in no time.

358
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,514
Crank it! Crank it!

359
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,394
Look!

360
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,992
(Yelling)

361
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,416
- Now!
- Aaaah!

362
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,107
(Screams)

363
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:10,659
Oh, no!

364
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:35,935
Oh, my...!

365
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,856
Helen!

366
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:45,319
Keep that gas going! Fill 'em up!

367
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,749
Aaargh!

368
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,900
Aargh!

369
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:29,446
It's the girl they want!
Give them Enola and they'll leave!

370
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:33,659
Come quickly! Helen!

371
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,549
Aah! Aaargh!

372
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:13,615
You're not supposed to go yet!
Infernal machine!

373
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,661
Damn you!

374
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,963
Infernal machine!

375
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,136
Gregor? Gregor! Wait!

376
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:37,639
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.
I couldn't make it stop. Hurry!

377
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:41,143
You can make it if you try!
Up those stairs! Run!

378
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,229
- Wait!
- Quickly! I'll throw you a rope!

379
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,483
- Run quickly!
- Throw the rope now!

380
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:50,319
Throw the rope! No!

381
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,529
- No!
- Wait!

382
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,241
- Don't leave us!
- No!

383
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,535
I'm sorry! It was an accident!

384
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,374
Helen!

385
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,710
Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!

386
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:28,774
Shoot him. Shoot him.

387
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,201
Aaargh!

388
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:59,304
If I let you out of here,
you're taking us with you.

389
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:01,265
Sure.

390
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,937
Enola, get down.

391
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:09,982
Come here. Get down.

392
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:12,109
Hurry! Come on!

393
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:16,363
Get the gate!

394
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,683
Argh!

395
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:07,623
Argh!

396
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:18,300
(Mariner) Hurry up!

397
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,260
Kamikaze! Come on!

398
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,958
That made a hole.

399
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,645
Find her! Get the girl!

400
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:17,818
There!

401
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:29,037
Go! Get that guy! Go! Kill him!

402
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,585
- Wow!
- Enola!

403
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:49,016
- You're too slow!
- Run to the other side.

404
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,269
Come on!

405
00:46:58,275 --> 00:47:01,320
Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

406
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:08,952
It's stuck! I can't make it through!
Let her go!

407
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:13,415
- (Bullets fly)
- Just drop her!

408
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,265
Turn the wheel! The wheel! Turn it.

409
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,396
That!

410
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,066
- Come on, push it!
- I am!

411
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,485
Hurry! Push it hard!

412
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,653
Push it hard!

413
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,739
OK, OK!

414
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:49,201
Now pull it! Pull it! Go! Go!

415
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:51,161
Pull it!

416
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:05,842
- Enola, jump.
- (Bullets hit hull)

417
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,346
- Just look at me! Jump!
- OK!

418
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,823
Well, excuse me!

419
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:31,952
Did I say anybody could leave
before the battle was over? Did I?

420
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:35,455
- No!
- Well, do something! I hate sails.

421
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,258
Hey!

422
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:50,095
- Can you steer?
- Can I trust you?

423
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:28,550
Answer me this, somebody.
Why is that boat still firing?

424
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:31,803
- What's that cousin's name?
- Chuck.

425
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:35,098
- Hey, Chuck!
- He's pulling him right into us!

426
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:39,561
Maybe he doesn't answer to Chuck.
Call him Charles. Charles!

427
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:45,775
- Stop him! Stop him!
- (Machine gun roars)

428
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:52,240
(Men cry out)

429
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:54,284
Charles!

430
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:59,289
Adios, cousins.

431
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:40,664
(Woman) Put me down! Put me down!

432
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,593
She's here somewhere. Keep looking!

433
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,227
(Chainsaw buzzes)

434
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:07,607
Ah!

435
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:11,778
(Stammers)

436
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:15,073
660 Gs of hydro,
three-quarter grade or better,

437
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:19,119
120 keys of assorted edibles -
fish and plankton cakes -

438
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:22,622
and 60 keys lamp oil,
44 old-grow grapevines,

439
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,833
ten assorted fruit trees,

440
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:29,379
zero reloads - no ammo storage
on this particular atoll.

441
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:33,592
Uh, zero go-juice.
No refining capability.

442
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:35,552
Primitive savages!

443
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:39,973
Oh... How about smokes?

444
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,267
Uh, zero. Zero smokes.

445
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:46,438
I remember when this used to be fun.

446
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:49,524
How long since we had
a really good crusade?

447
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:53,278
- I know, I know.
- Tell me, how long?

448
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:55,405
- I don't know...
- Remember,

449
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,742
there used to be atolls on every horizon.

450
00:51:58,867 --> 00:51:59,868
Mm-hm.

451
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,747
Where the hell are they all going?

452
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,874
Well, we sunk a few.

453
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:10,337
- I found this.
- Nord... Oh, now that's warmer.

454
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:14,966
- All right. And the girl?
- Not here. She might have gotten away.

455
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:18,720
That's why we came here!
We didn't come here to practice!

456
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,805
We don't need practice!

457
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,813
- What you got?
- A couple of heartbeats.

458
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,940
Aren't saying much.

459
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:36,446
If you notice the arterial nature
of the blood from the hole in my head,

460
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:40,533
you can assume we're all having
a real lousy day.

461
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:44,663
So here it is. I need to know
about that tattooed girl.

462
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:50,710
- First one that tells me lives.
- I saw a girl! I saw her!

463
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,837
She had a big tattoo on her.

464
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:57,342
You won. Start over.

465
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,553
I-I saw a girl. I'm not sure,

466
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:04,432
but I think she got on that boat
with three hulls.

467
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:08,436
The boat that cost me a thousand Gs
of go-juice?

468
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,064
- The Muto's boat.
- Muto?

469
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:13,942
Yeah, he's got these slits here,

470
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:17,404
like...like fish gills.

471
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,739
He wasn't really a man.

472
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,450
A fluke of evolution!

473
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,413
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of...

474
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:28,707
- Evolution.
- I know!

475
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:31,292
Let's have an intelligent conversation.

476
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:34,504
I'll talk and you listen.

477
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:38,633
In the beginning,
the provider said,

478
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:42,429
"Let there be water!"
and the seas came forth.

479
00:53:42,554 --> 00:53:47,183
- He created everything that we know...
- Hey, hey! The Deacon!

480
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,227
The air that we breathe!

481
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,313
He made also both man and fish

482
00:53:52,439 --> 00:53:55,150
and no combination thereof!

483
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,987
He does not abide the notion of evolution!

484
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:00,905
Amen!

485
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:06,619
- No! You said you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that? Witnesses? Anybody?

486
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:10,248
- Yes, yes, yes, you did.
- Ah, I may have!

487
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,461
I may have.

488
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,255
No!

489
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,470
We get to the 'Dez,

490
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:28,558
take up that sky boat,
send it out on patrol.

491
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:34,439
We got to keep an eye out
for that ichthy freak!

492
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,122
I know what you're thinking.

493
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:38,378
How much longer that hydro would last
if there weren't three of us on this boat.

494
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:43,132
Well, Enola won't drink much.

495
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,553
And I won't...

496
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:49,264
I won't drink at all.

497
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:51,558
Not till we get there.

498
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:53,810
Get where?

499
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:55,937
Wherever you're going.

500
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:59,274
Wherever you got your dirt.

501
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:04,237
I told you I salvaged it
off an atoll the Smokers hit.

502
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:09,242
Smokers don't leave anything after a raid.

503
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,202
Especially dirt.

504
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,248
You've been there, haven't you?

505
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,587
Dryland?

506
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,756
You know where it is.

507
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,636
- Yeah, I know where it is.
- Oh...

508
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,514
And...

509
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:35,393
- And we're going?
- You and I are.

510
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,273
The kid we've got to pitch over the side.

511
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:45,695
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

512
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:51,951
I'm taking on water. I'll be lucky to get
half a hydro ration out of that.

513
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,538
You know, I said I won't drink.

514
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,207
For 12 days?

515
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:05,924
No. It's better one of you dies now
than both of you die slow.

516
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:07,884
Wait, wait.

517
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:10,720
We saved your life. We got you out.

518
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:14,849
No, you got me out so you could get out.
We're even.

519
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:17,143
She can cook. She can fish.

520
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,270
- So can I.
- Take my necklace.

521
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:22,690
- I got better ones below.
- No, look! Oh.

522
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:28,071
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

523
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:30,990
I can understand why you would want to.

524
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,076
But she's a child.

525
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,746
(Humming)

526
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:46,506
Is there something else, then?

527
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,514
Enola, go below.

528
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,141
Enola.

529
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:21,040
Yeah.

530
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,084
You said so yourself.

531
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,671
Been out there a long time.

532
00:59:14,886 --> 00:59:18,890
A couple of hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

533
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:21,768
- We're not like that.
- You all are.

534
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,901
Know what I was really thinking?

535
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:33,696
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

536
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:36,657
You got nothing I need.

537
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,260
You're taking us to Dryland.

538
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,934
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

539
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:06,729
- Believe me, I'm not the one to start on.
- Both of us!

540
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:16,030
- How long do you plan to hold that on me?
- As long as it takes.

541
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:20,785
OK.

542
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,286
Ah!

543
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,582
Let me out! Let me out of here!

544
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:31,295
You coward! Don't you touch my child!

545
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,589
Come here! I...

546
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,592
(She grunts)

547
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,097
Oh...

548
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,223
Oh...

549
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,011
OK, now don't move, OK?

550
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:05,598
There. Oh, looking real good, yeah.

551
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:06,933
There.

552
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,727
There. All done.

553
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:13,773
Now there may be some small problem
in depth perception.

554
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:16,359
It better not screw up my short game.

555
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:19,779
Well?

556
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:23,241
- (Woman) Looks good.
- It's better than your real eye.

557
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:27,161
- Much better.
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.

558
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:31,499
- Looks like shit.
- That's why I love children. No guile.

559
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:36,837
It does look like shit!

560
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:42,051
- And it feels like cold shit!
- Deacon?

561
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:50,017
Sorry It's just there's a problem
in the pit. Maybe you should come.

562
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,732
Let's drive.

563
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:07,994
To the pit.
Don't bother with the scenic route.

564
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,453
Drive!

565
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,291
(Deacon) Hey, it's driving better.

566
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,963
(♪ "Peter Gunn Theme")

567
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:24,176
(Rowdy yelling)

568
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:26,554
Get off!

569
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:30,099
Get off! Get out the way!

570
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:34,186
- Get out the way!
- All right, all right. OK, OK.

571
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,401
Bless you, cousins.
Bless all you cousins over there.

572
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:44,447
Keep up the good work!
Growth is progress, growth is progress.

573
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:46,282
(Man) Somebody!

574
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,784
Hey, up there!

575
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:51,120
Take it off!

576
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:56,667
- Yes?
- Your Deaconship.

577
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,169
Hello!

578
01:03:58,294 --> 01:04:02,631
Good morning. Or night.
Whichever the case may be.

579
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:05,468
What is it? I'm a busy man.

580
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:09,388
I thought you should know
you're down to exactly

581
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:13,434
four feet nine inches of black stuff.

582
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,067
- Thank you, sir.
- How many Gs after refining?

583
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:25,279
- Maybe three refuelers.
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.

584
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:28,240
Sweet Joe! What's happening to this place?

585
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:33,079
- We outgrowed it.
- All right.

586
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:36,665
The only thing that is important
is the tattooed girl.

587
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,460
We don't spare any go-juice finding her.

588
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:44,256
We don't waste it anywhere else. Cancel
all those tractor pulls and all that stuff

589
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:46,842
until later. You got it?

590
01:04:48,344 --> 01:04:50,971
Dryland is the mother lode.

591
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:53,265
Ha-ha! On your toes.

592
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:19,208
Why don't you use sea hydro?

593
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,753
The salt's harder on the filters.

594
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:47,403
Can we have some?

595
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:52,283
It's for her, not me.

596
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,504
Here, come on.

597
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:10,509
- Is he going to take us to Dryland?
- Sure he is.

598
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:11,635
Yeah.

599
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:18,017
All of it, all of it, all of it.

600
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:23,439
Good. Good, good. Come on.

601
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,369
Thanks for not killing us.

602
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,597
Just stay away from him.

603
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:30,798
- Hi.
- Move.

604
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:34,260
(Helen) Enola! Enola, come here!

605
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:37,930
Come on!

606
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:42,601
Enola, come over here.

607
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:57,700
Hey!

608
01:07:59,994 --> 01:08:04,873
- What are you doing?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

609
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:11,547
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

610
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:14,592
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

611
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:18,721
- I drew it for you.
- Don't draw on anything! Understand?

612
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:30,733
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

613
01:08:30,858 --> 01:08:34,028
You take up space
and you're slowing me down.

614
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:41,619
You know, she's just a little girl.
She doesn't know your rules.

615
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:44,538
You wanna stay? You teach her.

616
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:05,476
Enola, what did I tell you?

617
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,900
You're not so tough, you know that?

618
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:19,239
How many people have you killed?

619
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,495
Ten? Twenty?

620
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:28,666
You talk a lot.

621
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:31,251
I talk a lot cos you don't talk at all.

622
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:33,295
So how many?

623
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:39,968
- Including little girls?
- I'm not afraid of you.

624
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:46,767
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

625
01:09:49,478 --> 01:09:53,732
In fact, you talk all the time!
It's like a storm when you're around!

626
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:56,568
(Helen) Enola! Hey, what are you doing?

627
01:09:56,694 --> 01:10:00,280
- Helen!
- She can't swim!

628
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:03,283
(Enola) Help me! Helen!

629
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:05,661
Helen, help me!

630
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,831
Help!

631
01:10:08,956 --> 01:10:11,458
Helen, help me!

632
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:22,010
Helen! Help!

633
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:23,929
Hold on.

634
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:26,724
Look at me, look at me.

635
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,395
Oh... Wait. Come on.

636
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,855
Please!

637
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,981
Please!

638
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:35,899
Oh, please!

639
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:37,985
(Helen coughs)

640
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,865
Hey!

641
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:48,120
Hold on. OK... Almost.

642
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:50,164
(Gasping)

643
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:01,216
(Enola gasps)

644
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:07,598
Thanks. But I swear,
if you ever touch her again...

645
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:12,728
Sonofabitch! Look at me! You'll go to bed
that night and you will never wake up.

646
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,938
- Shut up.
- What?

647
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,983
- (Helen) Smokers?
- Yeah.

648
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:20,068
Well, can't we outrun them?

649
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:24,364
- (Plane engine hums)
- Not with my sail down.

650
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:46,345
- What are you thinking about?
- That's a nice touch.

651
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,263
That's them!

652
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,980
Don't hit the kid!

653
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:03,320
(Laughing)

654
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:14,164
Hey!

655
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,171
Coward!

656
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,179
(Laughs)

657
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:31,390
- (Gun jams)
- Fuck!

658
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:01,837
No!

659
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:07,217
Hey! Urgh!

660
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,776
Cut it!

661
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:35,662
Come on! Come on!

662
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,851
(Mast creaking)

663
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:09,905
Aaah!

664
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:14,636
(Helen) Oh...I'm really sorry.

665
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:17,973
I'm sorry! You didn't give me much choice.

666
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,102
I know. But you ran away.

667
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:24,104
I... What?

668
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:27,065
What are you do...? No! Please, no!

669
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,197
(Grunting)

670
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:41,538
Don't ever touch anything
on my boat again.

671
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,127
She said she was sorry!

672
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,383
That means you're supposed to
say something back!

673
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:19,076
- Did you say something?
- (Enola) Mm-mm.

674
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,444
(Deacon) Fore!

675
01:16:54,569 --> 01:16:58,323
- Nice putt.
- It wasn't a putt. That was a drive.

676
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:01,409
I wasn't even using my good eye. Damn it!

677
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,789
You got an ashtray or something?

678
01:17:05,914 --> 01:17:07,916
Oh, man.

679
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,877
Damn thing never did work right.

680
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:13,588
- You said to bring the pilot.
- Yes, I did.

681
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:17,342
- Well, he's here.
- Why didn't you tell me?

682
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:21,012
Come on, Nord. Well, tell me about it.

683
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:26,101
- The child. Did he have her with him?
- Yeah. And some atoll bitch!

684
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:29,688
They killed Ed!

685
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:34,067
Now, now. Don't you fret yourself.
Plenty more where Ed came from.

686
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:37,445
- Heading west south-west?
- From here.

687
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:41,199
If we launch now,
we can cut him down just about here.

688
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,828
- If he doesn't change course.
- That's not likely.

689
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:47,998
He's a wily one, that ichthy demon.

690
01:19:31,518 --> 01:19:33,520
(Drifter calls out)

691
01:19:34,688 --> 01:19:36,982
- Drifter?
- Mm-hm.

692
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:38,900
Are we going to stop?

693
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:40,986
- (Drifter) Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

694
01:19:41,111 --> 01:19:43,780
I thought you all stopped for each other.

695
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:51,121
Maybe he has some FOOD!

696
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,252
Don't find many who follow the rules
any more.

697
01:19:57,377 --> 01:20:00,130
Make it quick. What's your business?

698
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:07,595
Trade.

699
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:11,391
Got any resin?

700
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:17,689
Resin? He's out of his mind.
He's out of his mind completely. Resin?

701
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:21,443
You've been outwater a long time,
haven't you?

702
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:25,530
Don't be joking me, man! Resin!
You don't got enough.

703
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,867
- How about food?
- Could you say that again, please?

704
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:31,870
- How about food?
- Well, yeah, food.

705
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,955
That'd be good, eh?

706
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,500
I haven't eaten in, well, you know,
forever.

707
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:43,506
Which one of you two is the cook, then?
I usually fall for the waitress.

708
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:48,762
- Like you said, I don't have much.
- I'll decide.

709
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:53,266
Look at you. We could start
with that wee orchard over there.

710
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:55,393
Woo!

711
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:58,688
(Mariner) All right. Hold it there.

712
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:01,816
- We can talk.
- Fair enough.

713
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,819
(Muttering)

714
01:21:07,781 --> 01:21:11,534
It's a nice rod, isn't it?
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

715
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:13,161
My favorite.

716
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:22,295
Got yourself a wee harem going here,
don't you now?

717
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:32,472
- What do you want for the women?
- We're not for sale.

718
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:36,476
Not for sale? I mean, there's
no such thing as not for sale.

719
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:38,561
Not for sale, not for sale. Aye.

720
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:44,067
Are they a pair
or would you sell them separate?

721
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:48,279
Our business is done here, unless
you've got some resin you can part with.

722
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:52,742
I told you once already, I don't have any.
I don't have it, don't have it.

723
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:57,205
Haven't seen any for trade in lunars now.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

724
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:03,920
I do have something
that'll make you change your mind.

725
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:06,256
Something you can't pass on.

726
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:10,927
I took it off an atoller refugee camp.

727
01:22:12,429 --> 01:22:15,056
Life savings of the entire clan.

728
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:25,024
Paper! Look at my wee paper.

729
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:31,239
Paper! Have you ever seen paper?
Look at it, smell it.

730
01:22:34,075 --> 01:22:36,453
I'm saving it for a special trade.

731
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:41,458
Don't you do it.

732
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:46,546
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person.
Whose boat is this anyway?

733
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:51,259
- Is it your boat or your boat?
- It's his boat, but he doesn't own us.

734
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:02,562
- Half an hour.
- He's obviously out of his mind.

735
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:05,523
I've got two pages in here, man!

736
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:09,235
- I'd get half a dozen girls with this.
- Half an hour.

737
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,697
- You trading or not?
- Don't!

738
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,824
Shut up.

739
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,035
OK.

740
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:23,917
45 minutes with the wee one. I like to do
the talkin', if you know what I mean.

741
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,587
No!

742
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:30,381
Fair enough.

743
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,592
Come, come, come, come, come.

744
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:35,053
No. My boat.

745
01:23:36,513 --> 01:23:39,140
That's fair enough.
Good, good, good, good, good.

746
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:40,350
Helen...

747
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:44,103
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

748
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,843
Half an hour.

749
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:00,847
Well...

750
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:05,476
It's been a while for me now.

751
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:10,356
Guess it's been more than a while,
actually, but...

752
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:14,819
I've only got half an hour.

753
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:18,906
Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour,
half an hour, half an hour.

754
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:21,075
OK, right, right, right.

755
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:26,497
You're so beautiful.
Anyone ever told you that?

756
01:25:26,623 --> 01:25:30,293
Give me that! What are you doing?
It's just a game!

757
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:33,379
Oh, I...

758
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:35,381
I... We was just playing.

759
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:40,553
Trade's off.

760
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:42,513
I changed my mind.

761
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,515
Well, um...

762
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:49,145
Well, you can't do that.
I mean, a deal's a deal. Aye.

763
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,481
I just did.

764
01:25:53,733 --> 01:25:56,944
She's mine, aye. No, no, no.
I won't have it.

765
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:58,780
- No.
- Go on.

766
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:02,617
Go, go, go, good. Aye, aye.
Don't go too far now!

767
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:05,578
This won't take but a minute.

768
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,751
I hate this boat.

769
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:14,629
I...hate...this...boat!

770
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:17,757
You garbage!

771
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:23,763
You...

772
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:29,185
You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't you?

773
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,198
Aargh!

774
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:44,409
(Crashing and yelling)

775
01:26:57,922 --> 01:26:59,799
Where's me boat?

776
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:02,802
Where's me boat?

777
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:06,013
(Mutters to himself)

778
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,562
Help me to me boat.

779
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,357
Ah! The boat...

780
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:54,395
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,

781
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,191
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

782
01:27:58,316 --> 01:28:02,153
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

783
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:05,114
The important question is
where's he headed?

784
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:08,284
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

785
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:10,286
Dryland.

786
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:12,663
Salvation.

787
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:15,124
Room to grow 18 holes.

788
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:17,293
36, 72!

789
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:22,173
I say that he's headed here
and we take him here.

790
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:52,370
How long before we get some wind?

791
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:54,789
Days, maybe.

792
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,667
Then why don't we fish?

793
01:28:57,792 --> 01:28:59,627
What for?

794
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:04,465
- So we can get something to eat?
- We ate two days ago.

795
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,008
You ate.

796
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:09,929
Just...

797
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:14,934
Just help me fix this.

798
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:18,354
I'll catch something myself.

799
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,233
You're not going to catch anything
with this around here.

800
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:24,902
Look,

801
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:28,239
we're not trying to make you angry.

802
01:29:31,117 --> 01:29:33,744
And you don't disappear
when you turn your back.

803
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:38,165
- You don't know what fishing's like here.
- Then you do it, if you're the authority.

804
01:29:49,552 --> 01:29:52,179
Maybe he doesn't know how to fish.

805
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:57,518
- I think you're right, Enola.
- Shut up, will ya?

806
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:01,981
- I'm trying to listen for engines.
- I will not shut up!

807
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:06,402
Until you stop what you're doing and help
me find something to eat for this child!

808
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:09,405
I will scream so loud that it...

809
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:13,117
Put that... No!

810
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:17,788
You'll never catch anything with this.
It's useless.

811
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:25,546
(Helen) Look, I'm sorry!

812
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:28,257
You were right about the pole.

813
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:30,259
You were right!

814
01:30:30,384 --> 01:30:32,386
But we have to eat.

815
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:39,268
I know you can hear me!

816
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:42,939
We can fish for ourselves.
Just show us what to do.

817
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:46,943
- You must know. Even you've got to eat!
- You just sit there.

818
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,635
What...?

819
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:44,583
(Muffled explosion)

820
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,341
Happy now?

821
01:31:56,345 --> 01:31:58,764
(Enola happily hums)

822
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:12,403
You don't like my singing, do you?

823
01:32:16,157 --> 01:32:20,411
Helen says you don't like my singing
cos you can't sing.

824
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:29,712
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

825
01:32:32,256 --> 01:32:34,050
The sound of the world.

826
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:42,850
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud.

827
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:46,353
And moving around all the time.
Try sitting still.

828
01:32:48,022 --> 01:32:50,107
Eyeball?

829
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:09,919
Go ahead. Drink all you want.

830
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,172
It's gonna rain tonight.

831
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:33,692
I wish I had feet like his.

832
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:40,449
- Then maybe I could swim.
- Enola...

833
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:46,038
(Belches) Sorry.

834
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:54,255
I never met a person
who couldn't swim before.

835
01:33:55,965 --> 01:33:57,466
I can't.

836
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:02,513
People said I was weird.

837
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,598
Maybe they're right.

838
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:10,688
Maybe they were right about you, too.

839
01:34:37,423 --> 01:34:39,383
(Wind whistles)

840
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:44,054
(♪ Mellow jazz trumpet plays)

841
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:16,503
Is that from Dryland?

842
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,340
(Turns music off)

843
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:20,549
Yeah.

844
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:28,390
(Sighs)

845
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:37,191
- I don't even know your name.
- I don't need one.

846
01:35:38,859 --> 01:35:41,153
Enola wanted to give this to you.

847
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,868
And this.

848
01:35:50,788 --> 01:35:52,998
She won't take it again.

849
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,173
You don't look much like her.

850
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:04,510
I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.

851
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:06,053
You act like it.

852
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:09,014
About six years ago,

853
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:13,811
this basket floated into the atoll
with Enola in it.

854
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:19,358
Of course, everyone wanted to shove her
back out to sea. That was the law.

855
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:22,236
She was so precious.

856
01:36:22,361 --> 01:36:24,530
I wanted to keep her.

857
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:29,576
So the Elders talked and said
that if I wanted her so badly,

858
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:32,329
I could never have a child of my own.

859
01:36:34,081 --> 01:36:37,042
There was no one else.
She would have died otherwise.

860
01:36:38,127 --> 01:36:39,211
So?

861
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:41,380
It's called compassion.

862
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:43,966
Oh...

863
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:49,096
You probably wouldn't understand
after being alone so much.

864
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:53,267
I'm not alone.
I've got this boat for a friend.

865
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:59,440
It don't lie to me,
don't cut my throat when I'm asleep.

866
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:01,900
Gives me a place to be.

867
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:04,320
I pity you, really.

868
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:08,073
- What's pity?
- You don't know?

869
01:37:08,198 --> 01:37:10,492
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

870
01:37:11,744 --> 01:37:15,664
Well, if you don't know,
I could never make you understand.

871
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:21,545
- What are those marks on her back?
- Nothing.

872
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:26,342
- They're just fanciful things.
- Like what she draws?

873
01:37:26,467 --> 01:37:30,804
She draws what she sees.
She's like a mirror.

874
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:34,892
People on the atoll thought she was a...

875
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:38,270
Freak?

876
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:43,567
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I just thought she was special.

877
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:55,079
I'm not giving it to her. It's just...

878
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:56,955
A loan.

879
01:37:57,081 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah. I'm not giving it to her.

880
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:08,008
Is Dryland beautiful?

881
01:38:10,177 --> 01:38:11,929
You'll see.

882
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,997
(Enola giggles)

883
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:27,171
Enola?

884
01:39:28,338 --> 01:39:30,340
Enola! What are you doing?

885
01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:33,927
- Those monsters will kill her!
- They're asleep now.

886
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:39,016
Hands around my neck.

887
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:45,856
Let the water tell your arms and legs
how to move. Going down. Hold your breath.

888
01:41:25,455 --> 01:41:28,417
- What is it?
- What is it?

889
01:41:30,252 --> 01:41:32,170
Barter outpost.

890
01:41:32,963 --> 01:41:37,801
- You said we'd get to Dryland today.
- Today, tomorrow. What does it matter?

891
01:41:39,428 --> 01:41:41,430
We need resin.

892
01:41:42,806 --> 01:41:45,017
(Speaks PortuGreek)

893
01:41:51,064 --> 01:41:53,775
- What is that?
- It's PortuGreek.

894
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,738
Their own language.

895
01:41:59,489 --> 01:42:01,491
That's what I thought.

896
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:29,102
Ah.

897
01:42:30,187 --> 01:42:33,815
There's my girl. Yes.

898
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:37,527
Howdy, darling.
Come on in here now.

899
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:09,476
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

900
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,773
What the hell...?

901
01:43:18,402 --> 01:43:20,153
He's spotted us!

902
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:23,031
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!

903
01:43:23,156 --> 01:43:25,200
Sound it! Sound it!

904
01:43:36,294 --> 01:43:38,839
Woo-hoo!

905
01:43:46,722 --> 01:43:48,306
Enola!

906
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:03,238
Starboard side! Now!

907
01:44:04,406 --> 01:44:06,241
Get in the chair!

908
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:15,500
Watch it! He's clearing the net!

909
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:29,014
Go to the helm!

910
01:44:30,891 --> 01:44:33,351
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

911
01:44:33,477 --> 01:44:37,272
What centerboard? Where exactly?
I don't know what to do!

912
01:44:37,397 --> 01:44:39,608
Under the helm, pull the handle!

913
01:44:42,152 --> 01:44:44,070
Hey. Hey!

914
01:44:46,615 --> 01:44:48,992
It's too late! Over here.

915
01:45:01,755 --> 01:45:03,131
Aaah!

916
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,262
No!

917
01:45:26,613 --> 01:45:28,240
Give me that rifle.

918
01:45:28,365 --> 01:45:32,911
Boy, if you want to do something right,
you've got to do it yourself.

919
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,872
All right.

920
01:45:36,957 --> 01:45:38,542
Ugh!

921
01:45:42,796 --> 01:45:44,047
I winged him.

922
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:48,009
Load all the go-juice onto one boat
and run the freak down.

923
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:51,263
You can't catch him with ten boats
and you want to send just one?

924
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:53,932
Well, I pray that you're joking.

925
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:03,817
Bring me the Trackers.

926
01:46:17,497 --> 01:46:22,168
You lied to us!
You were going to sell us back there!

927
01:46:22,294 --> 01:46:24,254
Then we both lied.

928
01:46:24,379 --> 01:46:25,422
What?

929
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:28,800
I saw what I saw.

930
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:31,928
- He's hurt.
- So he should be.

931
01:46:32,053 --> 01:46:33,388
He was going to sell us.

932
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:40,770
No wonder you let her keep it!

933
01:46:40,896 --> 01:46:42,522
You leave it!

934
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:48,820
- Why do they want her?
- There's nothing human about you.

935
01:46:48,945 --> 01:46:51,781
They should have killed you
the day you were born.

936
01:46:51,907 --> 01:46:53,825
They tried.

937
01:46:55,577 --> 01:46:57,579
No more lies.

938
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:02,334
- Ah!
- What are the marks on her back?

939
01:47:03,376 --> 01:47:06,296
People say it's the way to Dryland.

940
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:08,673
- Dryland's a myth!
- No!

941
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:12,761
You said so yourself that you know
where it is. You did.

942
01:47:17,599 --> 01:47:21,186
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

943
01:47:21,311 --> 01:47:25,690
I've seen it. I've touched it. Dirt
that was richer and darker than yours.

944
01:47:25,815 --> 01:47:27,651
In the basket we found Enola in!

945
01:47:27,776 --> 01:47:30,612
- It doesn't exist!
- How can you be so sure?

946
01:47:30,737 --> 01:47:35,200
I've sailed farther than most have
dreamed. And I've never seen it.

947
01:47:36,826 --> 01:47:41,623
- But the things on your boat.
- Things on my boat? What?

948
01:47:41,748 --> 01:47:45,919
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

949
01:47:46,044 --> 01:47:48,046
What are these shells?

950
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:50,715
And that reflecting glass?

951
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:53,885
And...and...and the music box.

952
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:59,516
If not from Dryland, then where? Where?

953
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,937
You want to see Dryland?

954
01:48:05,647 --> 01:48:08,066
You really want to see it?

955
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,736
I'll take you to Dryland.

956
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:26,751
Get in.

957
01:48:32,841 --> 01:48:36,011
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

958
01:48:36,136 --> 01:48:38,847
- Get in the water.
- It'll be all right.

959
01:48:51,026 --> 01:48:53,069
Don't touch anything.

960
01:48:57,532 --> 01:48:58,950
OK?

961
01:52:35,792 --> 01:52:37,752
I didn't know.

962
01:52:39,796 --> 01:52:41,756
All this time?

963
01:52:43,007 --> 01:52:46,177
- I didn't know.
- Nobody does.

964
01:52:55,061 --> 01:52:59,983
- Can you get us out of here?
- I'd say there's two chances of that.

965
01:53:00,692 --> 01:53:03,027
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

966
01:53:03,152 --> 01:53:06,572
Should have bought me that drink.
Come on!

967
01:53:06,698 --> 01:53:08,574
This way. Come on!

968
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:11,869
(Celebratory whooping)

969
01:53:11,995 --> 01:53:13,663
(Man) Yeah!

970
01:53:15,498 --> 01:53:19,836
Proper introductions first.
I'm the Deacon.

971
01:53:21,421 --> 01:53:23,214
(Laughing)

972
01:53:25,466 --> 01:53:30,346
If you don't recall the face, perhaps
it's cos I didn't always look like this.

973
01:53:33,266 --> 01:53:37,103
Now, I suspect
she's somewhere real close.

974
01:53:38,104 --> 01:53:40,273
So we could tear this boat apart,

975
01:53:40,398 --> 01:53:43,359
but I'd rather somebody just tell me
where she is.

976
01:53:43,484 --> 01:53:45,778
The first one that does that lives.

977
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:50,408
And the runner-up... Well, actually,
there are no runners-up.

978
01:53:53,286 --> 01:53:55,663
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

979
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:58,833
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.

980
01:54:00,168 --> 01:54:02,170
You know, personally,

981
01:54:03,171 --> 01:54:06,966
I'd rather shoot
the sperm of the devil here. Huh?

982
01:54:07,091 --> 01:54:09,093
But you know something?

983
01:54:09,218 --> 01:54:14,140
I don't think you're going to tell me,
are you? Huh? Too bad.

984
01:54:15,016 --> 01:54:16,934
Come on. Eh?

985
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:20,104
What do you say? She's not your kind.

986
01:54:21,689 --> 01:54:23,775
You don't even have a kind.

987
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,902
If you say it,

988
01:54:26,027 --> 01:54:28,529
he'll still kill us both.

989
01:54:33,117 --> 01:54:35,328
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

990
01:54:36,788 --> 01:54:38,748
If you don't tell me,

991
01:54:38,873 --> 01:54:42,293
I swear to Poseidon
that we'll torch your boat.

992
01:54:48,549 --> 01:54:51,928
Refresh my memory-
what if neither one of them talks?

993
01:54:52,053 --> 01:54:55,098
- Never happened before.
- Never happened before.

994
01:54:55,932 --> 01:55:00,853
All right! If they won't tell us
where she is, do 'em! Both of them!

995
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:03,189
- Just kill 'em now!
- No!

996
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,693
So gullible! Ha-ha! Bring her here.

997
01:55:09,237 --> 01:55:12,657
- (Smokers cheer)
- Seek and ye shall receive!

998
01:55:12,782 --> 01:55:16,285
So ends your daily sermonette!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

999
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:18,871
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1000
01:55:18,996 --> 01:55:20,206
Yes!

1001
01:55:21,207 --> 01:55:24,127
Here, take her, boys. Take care of her.

1002
01:55:25,878 --> 01:55:27,922
What is it?

1003
01:55:29,382 --> 01:55:30,800
Stunning.

1004
01:55:30,925 --> 01:55:35,596
I don't have words to even begin to...
It's magnificent.

1005
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:39,600
Look at that! That square footage.

1006
01:55:39,725 --> 01:55:41,102
Huh? Huh?

1007
01:55:41,227 --> 01:55:46,274
Now figure this map out. Turn her upside
down. Does that mean anything to you?

1008
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:47,400
No.

1009
01:55:47,525 --> 01:55:52,655
All right. We'll figure it out
back at the 'Dez, boys. Careful with her.

1010
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:57,076
- What about them?
- Do 'em both. Torch the boat.

1011
01:55:58,077 --> 01:55:59,454
Aargh!

1012
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,332
We have to go under!

1013
01:56:05,585 --> 01:56:08,212
No! I can't breathe like you!

1014
01:56:08,337 --> 01:56:11,048
I'll breathe for both of us.

1015
01:56:35,072 --> 01:56:36,073
Woo!

1016
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:42,788
(Enola) Helen, help!

1017
01:56:42,914 --> 01:56:44,624
Helen!

1018
01:56:44,749 --> 01:56:46,501
Helen!

1019
01:57:33,631 --> 01:57:35,466
My boat.

1020
01:57:45,268 --> 01:57:46,852
Enola...

1021
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:54,735
(Deacon) A-ha!

1022
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:57,113
All right!

1023
01:57:57,238 --> 01:58:02,368
I can't wait to get this thing out,
build some highways and some freeways!

1024
01:58:02,493 --> 01:58:06,706
There you go, cuz. Be careful now.
You break 'em, you can't use 'em.

1025
01:58:06,831 --> 01:58:09,166
Come on! What's happening, cousin?

1026
01:58:09,292 --> 01:58:12,753
Not a word.
She just sits there and leaks.

1027
01:58:12,878 --> 01:58:16,591
A shiver to the liver. This'll make her
give up all her secrets, huh?

1028
01:58:16,716 --> 01:58:20,970
Yeah, or kill her. Let me talk to her
first. I'm real good with kids.

1029
01:58:23,889 --> 01:58:27,393
What is this? Get those chains off her!

1030
01:58:27,518 --> 01:58:29,729
What are we, barbarians here?

1031
01:58:29,854 --> 01:58:32,773
Goodness gracious. Snakes alive.

1032
01:58:32,898 --> 01:58:35,901
Come on, out of here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

1033
01:58:36,986 --> 01:58:39,238
Rub-a-dub-dub. (Chuckles)

1034
01:58:41,032 --> 01:58:44,619
You want to come over here
and sit on my lap?

1035
01:58:44,744 --> 01:58:46,162
No.

1036
01:58:47,413 --> 01:58:49,665
How about a cigarette?

1037
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:53,961
Nothing like a good smoke
when you miss your mom.

1038
01:58:54,086 --> 01:58:56,005
Never too young to start.

1039
01:58:57,465 --> 01:58:58,841
No.

1040
01:58:58,966 --> 01:59:01,636
Well, I got something right here
I know you'd like.

1041
01:59:02,887 --> 01:59:06,098
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

1042
01:59:09,769 --> 01:59:11,979
Now they're yours,

1043
01:59:12,104 --> 01:59:16,901
if you help me
with just one problem. All right?

1044
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:20,821
Now I got this parish.

1045
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:22,948
A good parish.

1046
01:59:23,074 --> 01:59:25,117
A large parish.

1047
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:28,621
Getting larger all the time, in fact.

1048
01:59:28,746 --> 01:59:31,040
Now, you know,

1049
01:59:31,165 --> 01:59:33,668
I just don't have enough space

1050
01:59:35,044 --> 01:59:38,756
- for all these people.
- Why don't you make less people?

1051
01:59:38,881 --> 01:59:40,257
Pardon?

1052
01:59:41,342 --> 01:59:45,346
The atoll. Babies are born
only when there's room.

1053
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:49,100
That way,
there's food and hydro for everyone.

1054
01:59:49,225 --> 01:59:52,812
Well, that's a...quaint suggestion,

1055
01:59:53,813 --> 01:59:56,232
but it don't really play here,

1056
01:59:56,357 --> 02:00:00,653
considering we are, in fact,
the Church of Eternal Growth.

1057
02:00:02,071 --> 02:00:07,243
See, what we need is more land,
for more people.

1058
02:00:07,368 --> 02:00:10,496
Now... Now that tattoo on your back.

1059
02:00:10,621 --> 02:00:13,541
I've been told that that...

1060
02:00:13,666 --> 02:00:15,459
that's actually a map?

1061
02:00:18,003 --> 02:00:20,047
It's the way to Dryland.

1062
02:00:20,172 --> 02:00:22,258
Now we're getting someplace.

1063
02:00:24,677 --> 02:00:27,596
Could you teach me how to read that?

1064
02:00:29,348 --> 02:00:31,350
Setback.

1065
02:00:34,645 --> 02:00:39,275
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

1066
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:44,029
You know, like your mommy
or your pet fish? He say anything?

1067
02:00:44,155 --> 02:00:46,490
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

1068
02:00:46,615 --> 02:00:51,537
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like.
He took out my eye!

1069
02:00:51,662 --> 02:00:54,874
And if I ever see him again,
I'm gonna cut open his head

1070
02:00:54,999 --> 02:00:59,879
and I'm gonna eat his brain!
You think he'd like that?

1071
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:04,091
You can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

1072
02:01:05,134 --> 02:01:07,136
But he's not here.

1073
02:01:07,261 --> 02:01:09,263
And he ain't coming.

1074
02:01:09,388 --> 02:01:11,265
And no one's gonna save you.

1075
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,602
He'll come for me. He will.

1076
02:01:14,727 --> 02:01:16,812
Well, you better tell me
what I wanna know

1077
02:01:16,937 --> 02:01:21,317
or he can save what's left of you
in a goddamn jar!

1078
02:01:24,987 --> 02:01:27,031
I'm glad we had this little talk.

1079
02:01:28,574 --> 02:01:30,493
Chain her.

1080
02:01:32,787 --> 02:01:34,622
Chain her up.

1081
02:01:35,623 --> 02:01:38,584
He'll come for me! He'll take me away!

1082
02:01:50,012 --> 02:01:52,431
We're going to die here, aren't we?

1083
02:02:12,243 --> 02:02:14,119
Aren't we?

1084
02:02:23,462 --> 02:02:25,339
After the atoll,

1085
02:02:25,464 --> 02:02:28,008
when I offered myself to you,

1086
02:02:31,095 --> 02:02:33,305
why didn't you take me?

1087
02:02:35,891 --> 02:02:37,893
Cos you didn't really want me.

1088
02:02:39,979 --> 02:02:41,647
Not really.

1089
02:03:47,421 --> 02:03:49,632
Have I been sleeping?

1090
02:03:55,638 --> 02:03:57,431
I was dreaming.

1091
02:04:00,434 --> 02:04:02,227
It's funny.

1092
02:04:03,228 --> 02:04:05,606
I always thought Dryland floated.

1093
02:04:05,731 --> 02:04:09,610
Or drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

1094
02:04:09,735 --> 02:04:12,112
Why did you believe in it so much?

1095
02:04:13,322 --> 02:04:15,658
Cos we weren't made for the sea.

1096
02:04:17,201 --> 02:04:19,995
We've got our hands and our feet.

1097
02:04:20,496 --> 02:04:22,456
We're supposed to walk.

1098
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:28,170
I miss her sound.

1099
02:04:31,090 --> 02:04:32,883
Don't you?

1100
02:04:33,008 --> 02:04:35,260
Might get some hydro out of this.

1101
02:04:35,386 --> 02:04:37,388
I can't go on.

1102
02:04:39,473 --> 02:04:42,601
Not without her, or Dryland.

1103
02:04:42,726 --> 02:04:46,105
I don't want to live
if there's nothing left,

1104
02:04:47,272 --> 02:04:49,191
there's no hope.

1105
02:04:49,316 --> 02:04:51,068
You're still here.

1106
02:04:58,242 --> 02:05:00,536
Thank you for saving me.

1107
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:02,705
You can thank the Ancients.

1108
02:05:04,123 --> 02:05:08,669
- This is what they had.
- This is what they made of it.

1109
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:12,047
That's why I am what I am.

1110
02:05:12,172 --> 02:05:14,633
I may not be human, but I don't quit.

1111
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,136
Never have.

1112
02:05:18,137 --> 02:05:20,556
No matter what they throw at me, I...

1113
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:54,131
(Gregor) Helen!

1114
02:05:54,256 --> 02:05:56,216
Helen!

1115
02:05:56,341 --> 02:05:59,344
No, no, no, no! Helen, up! Above you!

1116
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:01,972
(Helen) Gregor!

1117
02:06:03,307 --> 02:06:05,100
(Gregor laughs)

1118
02:06:06,393 --> 02:06:09,063
Smart thinking to burn your boat!

1119
02:06:09,188 --> 02:06:12,983
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

1120
02:06:13,108 --> 02:06:17,696
Who's that with you?
Ichthys sapien! Is that really you?

1121
02:06:18,906 --> 02:06:22,826
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

1122
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:26,121
Helen!

1123
02:06:27,539 --> 02:06:30,542
- Where's Enola?
- Smokers took her.

1124
02:06:31,627 --> 02:06:33,796
They'd have me, too,
if it weren't for him.

1125
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:35,339
My friend,

1126
02:06:35,464 --> 02:06:38,258
thank you. Very human of you.

1127
02:06:39,259 --> 02:06:41,887
Grab your things quickly. Quickly.

1128
02:06:42,012 --> 02:06:43,013
Come.

1129
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:52,606
You see? Right down there.

1130
02:06:52,731 --> 02:06:56,527
There's several other survivors.
We'll just start over again.

1131
02:06:59,196 --> 02:07:03,200
Don't worry. They'll welcome you,
just like Gregor did.

1132
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:21,760
(Man) You can't ask us to go and get her.

1133
02:07:21,885 --> 02:07:24,930
(Woman) Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble. Forget it!

1134
02:07:25,055 --> 02:07:28,725
(Helen) They need to find Dryland
just like we do.

1135
02:07:28,851 --> 02:07:30,811
Of course.

1136
02:07:30,936 --> 02:07:33,564
(Helen) If the Mariner's willing to go
after her, then why not us?

1137
02:07:33,689 --> 02:07:37,734
(Woman) We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

1138
02:07:38,986 --> 02:07:40,571
Helen...

1139
02:07:40,696 --> 02:07:43,615
The papers the Mariner brought you.

1140
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:47,619
It's the same language
the tattoo is written in.

1141
02:07:47,744 --> 02:07:50,539
86...56.

1142
02:07:50,664 --> 02:07:56,044
27, 59. If I can figure out
what these numbers refer to...

1143
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,338
- They refer to nothing.
- What?

1144
02:07:58,463 --> 02:08:01,258
Dryland doesn't exist.

1145
02:08:01,383 --> 02:08:03,218
(Man) You're as crazy as she is!

1146
02:08:03,343 --> 02:08:08,473
We're wasting valuable time. More Smokers
will come. We need to be moving now.

1147
02:08:08,599 --> 02:08:12,436
- We need this child to find Dryland!
- I'm not going.

1148
02:08:12,561 --> 02:08:16,481
- (Man) I say let him go.
- (Woman) We're better off without them!

1149
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:26,575
You won't go after her either?

1150
02:08:30,537 --> 02:08:34,041
- I thought you were different.
- I am different.

1151
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:38,503
(Man) Hey, hey! That's my sail!

1152
02:08:39,671 --> 02:08:41,798
- What's he doing?
- Leaving.

1153
02:08:41,924 --> 02:08:43,842
Not in one of our boats!

1154
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:48,138
You can give it to him or he'll take it.

1155
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:04,488
Enola said you were her friend.

1156
02:09:04,613 --> 02:09:06,615
What do I tell her when I see her again?

1157
02:09:08,659 --> 02:09:10,035
Lies.

1158
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:14,748
If it makes you feel better.

1159
02:09:27,761 --> 02:09:31,974
Don't blame him.
Survival is all he knows.

1160
02:09:32,099 --> 02:09:35,686
That's why someday there will be
so many like him,

1161
02:09:35,811 --> 02:09:38,772
probably so few of us.

1162
02:11:21,666 --> 02:11:23,668
(Engines roar)

1163
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:35,889
- What do you want?
- Uh, all kinds of things.

1164
02:11:37,057 --> 02:11:39,226
But, uh, right now

1165
02:11:40,227 --> 02:11:44,147
we'll settle for everything you've got.
Ain't that right, Bones?

1166
02:11:44,272 --> 02:11:47,984
(Man) You destroyed our homes!
Why can't you leave us alone?

1167
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:51,363
I don't know.
It's a character thing, I guess.

1168
02:11:52,364 --> 02:11:54,366
Ain't that right, Bones?

1169
02:11:55,534 --> 02:11:56,910
Bones?

1170
02:11:57,494 --> 02:11:59,121
Bones?

1171
02:12:16,096 --> 02:12:18,348
I'm going after Enola.

1172
02:12:26,523 --> 02:12:31,278
Here, you know,
for a hideous freak, you're OK.

1173
02:12:32,487 --> 02:12:34,406
It was a joke!

1174
02:12:35,282 --> 02:12:38,994
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

1175
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:43,039
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location.

1176
02:12:43,165 --> 02:12:46,626
Latitude, longitude.
It doesn't make sense, though.

1177
02:12:46,751 --> 02:12:49,421
The numbers,
they seem to be backwards or something.

1178
02:12:49,546 --> 02:12:52,757
- It's upside down.
- The world?

1179
02:12:52,883 --> 02:12:56,970
- The poles have reversed themselves?
- I've been mapping the cities below.

1180
02:12:59,431 --> 02:13:02,976
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

1181
02:13:03,101 --> 02:13:05,896
- (Man) That's blasphemy!
- No, it's true.

1182
02:13:06,021 --> 02:13:09,399
I've seen it with my own eyes.
There's land.

1183
02:13:09,524 --> 02:13:13,236
- Right under our keel. None of it's dry.
- Some is.

1184
02:13:14,738 --> 02:13:19,284
Enola's been there. I know that now.
I saw what she drew.

1185
02:13:19,409 --> 02:13:23,205
That's why he's going after Enola.
To find Dryland.

1186
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:25,957
I don't care about Dryland.

1187
02:13:26,082 --> 02:13:29,669
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

1188
02:13:29,794 --> 02:13:33,340
He doesn't even know
which direction they came from.

1189
02:13:51,691 --> 02:13:54,653
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

1190
02:14:02,327 --> 02:14:06,790
(Woman) Forget about the Muto, Helen!
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

1191
02:14:06,915 --> 02:14:10,585
We've got to go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

1192
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:14,756
Don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

1193
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:32,649
- Hey, Doc, what's this?
- Where?

1194
02:14:32,774 --> 02:14:36,111
- Above the squiggle. Looks like a star.
- Or a meteor.

1195
02:14:36,236 --> 02:14:37,779
It's a mole.

1196
02:14:37,904 --> 02:14:42,534
- You got that tattoo figured out yet?
- It'd be easier if it was flat.

1197
02:14:42,659 --> 02:14:45,245
Big and flat. It needs to be flat.

1198
02:14:45,370 --> 02:14:49,165
- What have you got in mind?
- Well, you cut it off her back,

1199
02:14:49,291 --> 02:14:51,876
stretch it, mount it,
give us a proper look.

1200
02:14:52,002 --> 02:14:54,212
(Deacon)
Take her down below until I holler.

1201
02:14:55,422 --> 02:14:58,008
Saint Joe, we're close.

1202
02:14:59,509 --> 02:15:01,803
After centuries of shame.

1203
02:15:57,609 --> 02:15:59,653
(Distant echoing voices)

1204
02:16:32,227 --> 02:16:34,229
(Laughter and yelling)

1205
02:16:38,650 --> 02:16:42,529
- They're getting ugly.
- Don't I know it.

1206
02:16:42,654 --> 02:16:44,906
Announce me, cousin.

1207
02:16:49,285 --> 02:16:52,080
- Hey, here he is.
- (Crowd roars)

1208
02:16:52,205 --> 02:16:55,792
Rise up, brothers and sisters,

1209
02:16:57,293 --> 02:16:59,295
turn your eyes

1210
02:16:59,421 --> 02:17:03,049
and open your hearts
to your humble benefactor,

1211
02:17:03,174 --> 02:17:07,011
your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,

1212
02:17:07,137 --> 02:17:10,098
the Deacon of the 'Dez!

1213
02:17:10,223 --> 02:17:12,308
(Crowd roars)

1214
02:18:02,192 --> 02:18:04,027
(Deacon) Children,

1215
02:18:04,152 --> 02:18:06,529
children of the provider,

1216
02:18:07,906 --> 02:18:12,619
citizens of the good ship,
please now, hear me speak.

1217
02:18:16,873 --> 02:18:19,834
- I've had a vision.
- (Man) We're tired of your visions!

1218
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:22,212
What about the land you promised us?

1219
02:18:22,337 --> 02:18:24,088
(Crowd cheers)

1220
02:18:24,214 --> 02:18:26,174
- Yeah!
- (Deacon) Oh, ye of little faith.

1221
02:18:27,509 --> 02:18:29,719
I've had a vision so great,

1222
02:18:29,844 --> 02:18:32,722
that as it came to me, I wept.

1223
02:18:32,847 --> 02:18:38,353
- And in this splenditudinous...
- (Smoker) Is that Bone's vehicle?

1224
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:42,649
(Deacon) I saw - and you know
what it is that I saw.

1225
02:18:43,608 --> 02:18:45,151
I saw...

1226
02:18:46,402 --> 02:18:48,863
- the land.
- (Cheering)

1227
02:19:15,265 --> 02:19:17,267
(Crowd chanting)

1228
02:19:28,069 --> 02:19:31,406
- Horse, is that you?
- (Jet ski engine revs)

1229
02:19:35,869 --> 02:19:39,539
Look, just bring it in slow, OK?
I don't have all day.

1230
02:19:39,664 --> 02:19:40,957
(Engine revs)

1231
02:19:41,082 --> 02:19:42,542
Horse!

1232
02:19:42,667 --> 02:19:45,295
Just bring it up slow.

1233
02:19:46,296 --> 02:19:48,006
I said slow!

1234
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:09,777
You killed Smitty, cousin.

1235
02:20:13,406 --> 02:20:15,950
- Nice landing!
- (Laughter)

1236
02:20:16,075 --> 02:20:18,912
Smitty, man, always in the way!

1237
02:20:22,206 --> 02:20:24,626
Smitty? I quit!

1238
02:20:26,544 --> 02:20:28,713
I'm in charge now, baby!

1239
02:20:28,838 --> 02:20:31,591
Yeah, I'm in charge.

1240
02:20:31,716 --> 02:20:34,177
I'm in charge!

1241
02:20:40,224 --> 02:20:43,853
(Deacon)
'And he said this to me personally.

1242
02:20:45,647 --> 02:20:49,776
'We are to go there
and we are to settle it.

1243
02:20:49,901 --> 02:20:52,111
'And we are to build the...'

1244
02:20:53,071 --> 02:20:57,075
You shouldn't be doing that.
You're going to get in trouble.

1245
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:59,118
Huh! That's right.

1246
02:20:59,243 --> 02:21:03,665
You're not afraid. You've got
your pet freak coming to rescue you.

1247
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:06,209
He's not a freak
and he can take you any time!

1248
02:21:08,211 --> 02:21:12,632
He's killed dozens of people.
He doesn't have any mercy or anything.

1249
02:21:12,757 --> 02:21:14,676
He even kills little girls.

1250
02:21:16,594 --> 02:21:18,137
Haven't we all?

1251
02:21:20,139 --> 02:21:21,182
Dang!

1252
02:21:22,392 --> 02:21:23,476
It's Horse.

1253
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:28,314
Find him! Find him!

1254
02:21:30,233 --> 02:21:32,694
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1255
02:21:32,819 --> 02:21:36,406
- Come on.
- Getting nervous, aren't you?

1256
02:21:40,368 --> 02:21:42,370
I don't get nervous.

1257
02:21:43,871 --> 02:21:46,708
(Deacon)
And if there's a river, we'll dam it!

1258
02:21:46,833 --> 02:21:50,461
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it!

1259
02:21:51,462 --> 02:21:54,132
Cos I'm talkin' progress here!

1260
02:21:54,257 --> 02:21:55,675
Yes, sir!

1261
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:58,803
- I'm talkin' development!
- Yeah!

1262
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:03,266
We shall suck and savor
the sweet flavor

1263
02:22:03,391 --> 02:22:05,935
of Dryland.

1264
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:07,937
(Enola) Your face is all red.

1265
02:22:09,522 --> 02:22:14,110
Helen said anybody that has a face
that red has either had too much sun

1266
02:22:14,235 --> 02:22:17,447
- or too much to drink.
- All right, that's it.

1267
02:22:17,572 --> 02:22:20,491
- I'm gonna burn your face!
- All right.

1268
02:22:20,616 --> 02:22:24,620
- What's up?
- We're just talking about her friend.

1269
02:22:26,039 --> 02:22:28,833
- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

1270
02:22:28,958 --> 02:22:33,337
- So Death can't find him.
- (Mocking noises)

1271
02:22:36,841 --> 02:22:39,927
He doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

1272
02:22:40,928 --> 02:22:43,723
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

1273
02:22:43,848 --> 02:22:46,768
He's fast and strong like a big wind.

1274
02:22:47,769 --> 02:22:51,564
He can hear 100 miles
and see 100 miles underwater.

1275
02:22:51,689 --> 02:22:54,192
He can hide in the shadow of a noon sun.

1276
02:22:54,984 --> 02:22:59,197
He could be right behind you and you won't
even know it till you're dead!

1277
02:23:00,656 --> 02:23:02,575
Give it a rest.

1278
02:23:04,077 --> 02:23:07,497
- He'll come for me. He will.
- Yeah?

1279
02:23:08,664 --> 02:23:10,625
Well, I hope he does.

1280
02:23:14,170 --> 02:23:16,130
Remember you said that.

1281
02:23:17,507 --> 02:23:20,051
(Deacon) Look at us.

1282
02:23:20,176 --> 02:23:22,303
Look at us here today.

1283
02:23:22,428 --> 02:23:26,015
Dryland is not just our destination,

1284
02:23:26,849 --> 02:23:29,769
but it is our destiny!

1285
02:23:31,145 --> 02:23:33,106
(Speech continues)

1286
02:23:38,069 --> 02:23:40,446
Find him! Find him!

1287
02:23:40,571 --> 02:23:44,951
How can I find this glorious place?

1288
02:23:45,952 --> 02:23:48,079
And he said to me,

1289
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:50,915
"A child

1290
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,501
"shall lead you."

1291
02:23:54,502 --> 02:23:56,295
A child.

1292
02:23:56,420 --> 02:23:58,756
- And behold...
- It's time.

1293
02:23:58,881 --> 02:24:01,843
The instrument of our salvation!

1294
02:24:03,845 --> 02:24:05,721
(Crowd roars)

1295
02:24:09,433 --> 02:24:11,853
Our guide in the wild!

1296
02:24:11,978 --> 02:24:14,313
Our beacon in the darkness!

1297
02:24:14,438 --> 02:24:16,524
Turn her around, Nord.

1298
02:24:16,649 --> 02:24:19,152
She has shown me the path!

1299
02:24:23,447 --> 02:24:27,076
And before the holy-most moment
is upon us,

1300
02:24:27,201 --> 02:24:30,580
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe!

1301
02:24:33,875 --> 02:24:37,461
And let's get this tub of shit
up to speed!

1302
02:24:39,547 --> 02:24:42,049
(Chaotic yelling)

1303
02:24:43,259 --> 02:24:44,385
Yep.

1304
02:25:23,299 --> 02:25:26,677
- Stroke!
- Pull!

1305
02:25:27,929 --> 02:25:29,138
Stroke!

1306
02:25:29,263 --> 02:25:31,057
Pull!

1307
02:25:32,516 --> 02:25:34,393
Stroke!

1308
02:25:37,730 --> 02:25:39,523
(Galley master) Stroke!

1309
02:25:41,317 --> 02:25:42,944
Stroke!

1310
02:25:50,576 --> 02:25:53,412
- So which way are we rowing?
- I don't have a goddamn clue!

1311
02:25:53,537 --> 02:25:58,960
Don't worry. They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm faking it.

1312
02:25:59,085 --> 02:26:02,922
- But, um... Why?
- Oh, you want details?

1313
02:26:03,047 --> 02:26:07,134
Well, I'm not telling these savages
we haven't solved the map yet.

1314
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:12,306
I promised them results and I'll get 'em
if I gotta cut 'em out of her back!

1315
02:26:14,183 --> 02:26:17,186
Who is that? Who is that?

1316
02:26:18,354 --> 02:26:20,690
(Man) Maybe one of the spare rowers?

1317
02:26:28,572 --> 02:26:31,367
Why aren't you rowing?

1318
02:26:40,001 --> 02:26:42,336
- It's him!
- It is him.

1319
02:26:43,337 --> 02:26:46,340
You guys are in so much trouble.

1320
02:26:49,051 --> 02:26:52,430
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

1321
02:26:53,431 --> 02:26:55,433
He's like a turd that won't flush.

1322
02:26:56,559 --> 02:26:58,436
I want the girl.

1323
02:27:02,606 --> 02:27:07,069
You know,
I thought you were stupid, friend.

1324
02:27:08,195 --> 02:27:10,656
But I underestimated you.

1325
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:13,784
You are a total freakin' retard!

1326
02:27:13,909 --> 02:27:15,911
(Maniacal laughter)

1327
02:27:17,038 --> 02:27:20,124
I want the girl. That's all.

1328
02:27:20,249 --> 02:27:23,961
What on this screwed-up earth
makes you think you're going to get her?

1329
02:27:33,471 --> 02:27:35,473
You know what this is?

1330
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:42,021
I drop it, you burn.

1331
02:27:42,146 --> 02:27:44,398
We all burn.

1332
02:27:44,523 --> 02:27:46,484
No, wait, wait, wait.

1333
02:27:47,234 --> 02:27:49,779
Let's not do anything rash here.

1334
02:27:49,904 --> 02:27:53,157
I mean, are you sure she's worth all this?

1335
02:27:53,282 --> 02:27:56,702
She never does stop talking.
She never shuts up.

1336
02:27:56,827 --> 02:27:58,788
- I noticed.
- What is it, then?

1337
02:27:58,913 --> 02:28:01,207
Huh? It's the map.

1338
02:28:02,208 --> 02:28:03,876
She's my friend.

1339
02:28:05,586 --> 02:28:08,798
Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.

1340
02:28:08,923 --> 02:28:11,509
You're gonna die for your friend.

1341
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:14,678
If it comes to that.

1342
02:28:17,014 --> 02:28:18,641
He's bluffing! I'll kill him.

1343
02:28:18,766 --> 02:28:22,645
- He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.
- Shut up!

1344
02:28:24,063 --> 02:28:27,817
You know, I don't think you're going to
drop that torch, my friend.

1345
02:28:28,818 --> 02:28:32,613
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

1346
02:28:36,492 --> 02:28:38,244
No!

1347
02:28:46,293 --> 02:28:48,045
Oh, thank God.

1348
02:28:52,758 --> 02:28:54,260
Aargh!

1349
02:29:00,724 --> 02:29:02,726
(Heavy gunfire)

1350
02:29:05,896 --> 02:29:08,149
(Man) Look out!

1351
02:29:08,274 --> 02:29:10,693
Get him!

1352
02:29:10,818 --> 02:29:13,028
Let's go, goddamnit!

1353
02:29:14,363 --> 02:29:15,739
(Man screams)

1354
02:29:15,865 --> 02:29:19,118
Don't just stand there - kill something!

1355
02:29:22,121 --> 02:29:24,248
Was this your big vision?

1356
02:29:31,255 --> 02:29:32,840
Aaargh!

1357
02:29:32,965 --> 02:29:34,467
Ah!

1358
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:36,844
I've always wanted to drive this monster!

1359
02:29:39,263 --> 02:29:42,057
(Man) There he is! There he is!

1360
02:29:46,437 --> 02:29:48,189
That's him there!

1361
02:29:51,025 --> 02:29:52,026
Aargh!

1362
02:29:56,739 --> 02:29:57,740
Aaaargh!

1363
02:30:08,834 --> 02:30:10,836
(Enola) Let me go!

1364
02:30:10,961 --> 02:30:12,963
Let go!

1365
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:20,221
(Explosion)

1366
02:30:22,139 --> 02:30:23,516
Let me go!

1367
02:30:27,811 --> 02:30:30,272
(Enola) Let me go! Let go!

1368
02:30:30,397 --> 02:30:32,233
Let me go!

1369
02:30:33,108 --> 02:30:35,861
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:30:38,864 --> 02:30:41,617
Let me go! Let go!

1371
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:48,332
(Laughs)
You should have stayed on the water.

1372
02:30:48,457 --> 02:30:50,251
(Clicks)

1373
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,345
You know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

1374
02:31:01,470 --> 02:31:05,224
Ow! Now you stop it!
You behave yourself now!

1375
02:32:00,279 --> 02:32:01,447
Up!

1376
02:32:31,101 --> 02:32:32,895
(Explosion)

1377
02:32:41,445 --> 02:32:43,947
It's going down. It's sinking!

1378
02:32:44,073 --> 02:32:48,661
- Gregor, bring us right down on top.
- Hurry, Gregor!

1379
02:32:48,786 --> 02:32:50,913
- (Gregor) Don't worry!
- Hurry.

1380
02:32:55,918 --> 02:32:57,836
(Hull creaks)

1381
02:33:05,469 --> 02:33:07,846
Enola! Up here! Grab on!

1382
02:33:14,186 --> 02:33:15,854
Are they on yet?

1383
02:33:19,358 --> 02:33:22,027
- What is it?
- I don't know!

1384
02:33:23,237 --> 02:33:25,114
No!

1385
02:33:34,039 --> 02:33:38,585
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out!

1386
02:33:42,423 --> 02:33:44,341
Aaaah!

1387
02:33:47,928 --> 02:33:49,430
Aaargh!

1388
02:33:52,474 --> 02:33:54,977
Pull! Almost!

1389
02:34:00,274 --> 02:34:02,276
(Gregor laughs)

1390
02:34:03,402 --> 02:34:04,987
(Explosion)

1391
02:34:34,099 --> 02:34:35,100
No!

1392
02:34:35,225 --> 02:34:37,770
- Aaaaargh!
- No! Enola!

1393
02:34:40,314 --> 02:34:42,566
Saint Joe! Hole in one.

1394
02:34:42,691 --> 02:34:45,110
- Helen!
- Enola!

1395
02:34:45,235 --> 02:34:47,696
- (Gregor) Helen!
- Hey!

1396
02:34:47,821 --> 02:34:49,198
Hey!

1397
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:57,247
If I can't have Dryland, no one will!

1398
02:35:00,751 --> 02:35:04,713
Oh... Oh, no, quick!
What are we going to do?

1399
02:35:08,091 --> 02:35:09,176
Tie this off!

1400
02:35:14,056 --> 02:35:15,808
Hurry! Tie it!

1401
02:35:21,438 --> 02:35:23,941
- Got it!
- Ah!

1402
02:35:27,069 --> 02:35:28,987
Aaaargh!

1403
02:35:36,912 --> 02:35:38,831
Get them up now!

1404
02:35:45,921 --> 02:35:47,714
(Straining)

1405
02:35:56,139 --> 02:35:58,141
Of course.

1406
02:36:00,227 --> 02:36:02,145
Of course, the numbers.

1407
02:36:02,271 --> 02:36:04,481
The numbers! They...

1408
02:36:04,606 --> 02:36:07,276
(Giggling) That must be it!

1409
02:36:07,401 --> 02:36:08,944
What?

1410
02:36:09,069 --> 02:36:12,531
- I was swimming.
- I saw.

1411
02:36:12,656 --> 02:36:14,908
(Gregor) My friends, my friends, look!

1412
02:36:15,033 --> 02:36:18,161
Look, this map...

1413
02:36:19,246 --> 02:36:23,500
This map, it bears a grid system
with numbers the Ancients used

1414
02:36:23,625 --> 02:36:26,295
to determine geographic location
on the world,

1415
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:30,090
just like the numbers and symbols
on Enola's back.

1416
02:36:31,967 --> 02:36:36,430
First, they would determine
the angle of the sun using this

1417
02:36:36,555 --> 02:36:41,059
and that would tell them where they were
and which direction they had to go.

1418
02:36:42,686 --> 02:36:47,733
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the co-ordinates on Enola's back,

1419
02:36:50,485 --> 02:36:52,362
then Dryland is that way!

1420
02:36:52,487 --> 02:36:54,072
(He chuckles)

1421
02:38:01,974 --> 02:38:04,059
(Seagulls cry)

1422
02:38:56,028 --> 02:38:59,698
- (Helen laughs)
- It's fresh! All of this!

1423
02:38:59,823 --> 02:39:01,616
It's fresh!

1424
02:39:04,327 --> 02:39:06,329
(Gregor laughs)

1425
02:39:07,789 --> 02:39:09,791
(Helen) Come on!

1426
02:39:14,963 --> 02:39:16,089
Woo!

1427
02:39:17,257 --> 02:39:19,968
I've found something!

1428
02:40:17,692 --> 02:40:20,946
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.

1429
02:40:21,530 --> 02:40:23,532
I think it was their way.

1430
02:40:25,659 --> 02:40:27,744
(Gregor)
They must have known they were dying.

1431
02:40:27,869 --> 02:40:29,746
(Helen laughs)

1432
02:40:52,269 --> 02:40:54,437
(Music box plays)

1433
02:40:58,441 --> 02:41:00,277
I'm home.

1434
02:41:11,079 --> 02:41:14,374
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

1435
02:41:18,920 --> 02:41:21,756
Wait! Wait, I want to show you this.

1436
02:41:37,397 --> 02:41:39,399
(Thunder of hooves)

1437
02:41:43,069 --> 02:41:44,905
(Whinnying)

1438
02:41:54,039 --> 02:41:56,249
(Chorus of bird calls)

1439
02:42:39,459 --> 02:42:42,337
First time in your life you got nothing
to say?

1440
02:42:56,476 --> 02:42:58,853
Enola, I have to go now.

1441
02:42:59,854 --> 02:43:02,148
But you came back for me.

1442
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:05,402
I like you.

1443
02:43:10,657 --> 02:43:12,617
Why are you leaving?

1444
02:43:16,121 --> 02:43:20,041
- I don't belong here. I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1445
02:43:22,043 --> 02:43:25,463
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1446
02:43:25,588 --> 02:43:28,883
Helen said that it's only landsickness.

1447
02:43:29,592 --> 02:43:31,928
We're all feeling it. It'll go away soon.

1448
02:43:33,638 --> 02:43:35,598
It's more than that.

1449
02:44:22,395 --> 02:44:24,397
Well, goodbye, my friend.

1450
02:44:27,317 --> 02:44:29,778
Oh, I have something for you.

1451
02:44:31,154 --> 02:44:32,989
It's dirt!

1452
02:44:34,157 --> 02:44:36,785
Don't trade it all in one place.

1453
02:44:38,536 --> 02:44:42,665
Or do! It will give you reason
to come back for more!

1454
02:44:42,791 --> 02:44:44,793
(Gregor laughs)

1455
02:44:46,461 --> 02:44:50,382
- It's all I got, Drifter.
- It's enough.

1456
02:44:59,933 --> 02:45:03,103
Is it that easy for you
to just drift away?

1457
02:45:03,228 --> 02:45:05,397
I never said it was easy.

1458
02:45:07,732 --> 02:45:09,734
I don't understand.

1459
02:45:15,323 --> 02:45:17,283
I don't understand.

1460
02:45:18,410 --> 02:45:20,412
I mean, you brought us here.

1461
02:45:20,537 --> 02:45:23,123
You belong here as much as anyone.
Maybe more.

1462
02:45:29,003 --> 02:45:33,299
What do you think you're going to find?
What are you looking for out there?

1463
02:45:33,425 --> 02:45:37,053
Gregor once said there might be
others like me somewhere.

1464
02:45:39,597 --> 02:45:42,058
I have to know.

1465
02:45:43,643 --> 02:45:45,478
Helen, if...

1466
02:45:45,603 --> 02:45:48,690
If I find any others out there like you,

1467
02:45:50,358 --> 02:45:52,360
I'll tell them about this place

1468
02:45:52,485 --> 02:45:57,282
and how one woman with hope and courage
found it.

1469
02:46:37,197 --> 02:46:39,866
I have something for you.

1470
02:46:40,617 --> 02:46:44,913
- Something you'll need on your journey.
- I don't have much to barter with.

1471
02:46:45,038 --> 02:46:47,040
It's no trade. It's a gift.

1472
02:46:48,124 --> 02:46:52,295
- No such thing in Waterworld.
- Well, then, let this be the first.

1473
02:46:54,214 --> 02:46:56,049
It's a name.

1474
02:46:57,050 --> 02:47:01,012
It's from an old story about a great
warrior returning from battle.

1475
02:47:01,137 --> 02:47:04,933
He just set sail
and the water god cursed him,

1476
02:47:05,058 --> 02:47:07,685
and for the next ten years
he drifted on the seas.

1477
02:47:07,810 --> 02:47:11,523
The warrior drifted on the seas,
unable to find his way home,

1478
02:47:11,648 --> 02:47:14,067
until finally the gods took pity on him.

1479
02:47:14,192 --> 02:47:17,403
And they called up a warm wind
that blew him home.

1480
02:47:17,529 --> 02:47:19,614
To his family.

1481
02:47:20,823 --> 02:47:23,243
And he never left them again.

1482
02:47:25,703 --> 02:47:28,373
His name was Ulysses.

1483
02:47:31,501 --> 02:47:33,461
It's a good name.

1484
02:48:22,510 --> 02:48:24,345
(Panting)
