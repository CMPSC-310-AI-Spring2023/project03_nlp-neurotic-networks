1
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:27,433
Good morning. On this day,
July 1st, 2014. At this hour, 0600.

2
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:29,644
We are at the very first airport in the world...

3
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:33,773
The CW-7, which despite being the topic of
so much controversy over the past 7 years,

4
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,942
has continued development.

5
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:41,781
Protests from environmental groups and
a number of developing countries continue...

6
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:47,036
It has been claimed that CW-7
is the answer to global warming.

7
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:48,663
And we are witnessing it!

8
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:53,292
...world leaders, who argue that
global warming can no longer be ignored.

9
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,966
Today, 79 countries will begin dispersing CW-7
into the upper layers of the atmosphere.

10
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,426
...spray out into the upper layers of
the atmosphere and

11
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:06,973
surprisingly bring down average
global temperatures to the finest levels.

12
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,102
It is just a day away that
our long time crisis of global warming...

13
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:16,649
According to scientists, the artificial cooling
substance CW-7 will succeed

14
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,444
in bringing average global temperatures
down to manageable levels,

15
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:24,615
as a revolutionary solution to
mankind's warming of the planet.

16
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,908
Head check!

17
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,666
Alright. Get in line.

18
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,542
Everybody sit down.

19
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,752
One.

20
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,379
Two.

21
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,672
Three.

22
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:03,881
Four.

23
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,091
Five.

24
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,050
Six.

25
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,677
Keep going.

26
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,220
Go on.

27
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,936
Hey you. Sit down!

28
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,313
Curtis, sit down.

29
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,109
Sit down!

30
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,820
I said sit down!

31
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,409
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

32
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,620
Can't you sit and count?
You wanna get shot? You're crazy.

33
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:36,956
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

34
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,628
Are there any experienced violinists here?
Raise your hands!

35
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,422
Violinist!

36
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,382
Stand up, come forward.

37
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,551
Food! Come and get it.

38
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,678
Violinists? They're having a laugh?

39
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,472
Those bastards in the Front Section,
think they own us.

40
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:57,143
Eating steak dinners and listening to
string quartets and that.

41
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,520
We'll be different when we get there.

42
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,815
I want steak.

43
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:09,155
Excuse me sir!

44
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:13,326
My wife and I played violin
in the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

45
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,244
I was first chair.

46
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:16,787
Can you still play?

47
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,497
Of course. You never forget.

48
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,541
Show me your hands.

49
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,087
You. Follow me.

50
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,340
Leave your belongings, we just need your hands.

51
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:29,342
Not both?

52
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:31,469
Yes. Both hands.

53
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:35,181
My wife, Doris, plays beautifully.
Better than me even.

54
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,350
They just need one person.

55
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,227
Then I won't go.

56
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,688
Doris, Doris.

57
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,611
Sit down everyone.

58
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,696
- Sit down, Edgar.
- They can't just...

59
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:52,198
Sit down.

60
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:54,575
Fucking bastards.

61
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,202
Now isn't the time.

62
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,787
Well when is the time?

63
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,663
Soon.

64
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,626
Doris, I'll be back Doris. It's alright.

65
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,630
I'll come back.

66
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,232
What does the steak taste like again?

67
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,275
I had it once, but I can't remember...

68
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,403
If you can't remember then it's better to forget.

69
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,572
Alright then, what does it,
what does it smell like when it's cooking and that?

70
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,491
When it emanates around the place.

71
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,910
Curtis, is this it?

72
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,245
It's not it.

73
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,538
And I've heard this...

74
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,748
Curtis! Here!

75
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,214
Tim-bo. How's it hanging, buddy?

76
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,426
Give me a pound. Blow it up.

77
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:58,431
Hey, listen. I think I need that protein block.

78
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,892
How about I trade you? This one for that one?

79
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:05,688
No.

80
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,190
Nice bargaining, Curtis. Here.
Give me this one, I'll give you that.

81
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,942
Hey, relax, relax.

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,986
Come here, Timmy. Come here.

83
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,989
Come right...

84
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,117
I have an idea.

85
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:22,955
I'll give you this one and that one for that one.

86
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:24,582
What do you say?

87
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,833
No.

88
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:27,960
Go get him.

89
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,338
Timmy!

90
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,802
Timothy! Your mom's gonna give you
a damn good spanking!

91
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,304
Where the fuck he went?

92
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,807
Hey, come here. Come here. Give us it. Give us it.

93
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,517
You're alright, Jose. How you doing man?

94
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,897
Timmy! Work with me here!

95
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,648
Edgar, why did you let him get up there?

96
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,151
No, I didn't. He got up there by himself.
He's very nimble.

97
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,278
- He's five.
- He's a very nimble five year old.

98
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:57,239
Timmy! Sweetie, come down.

99
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,410
Come here.

100
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,162
What do you want for it?

101
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,331
In the whole wide train?

102
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,333
In the whole wide train.

103
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,667
The ball!

104
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,922
The ball? No, no, I'm sorry,
I can't do that. I can't do that.

105
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:16,842
Yes. I get the ball for a whole hour.

106
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:24,517
Done.

107
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,020
Curtis. Is it time?

108
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,524
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

109
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,713
Red letter?

110
00:08:55,048 --> 00:09:00,135
Yeah. It's the one we've been waiting for.
Our informant gave us the name.

111
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:05,558
N, A, M...

112
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:08,644
Nam Koong Min Soo.

113
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:12,147
He's a security expert.
He's in the Prison Section now.

114
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,066
Wait! You're joking, right?

115
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,568
- He's in prison?
- Hey, out of here.

116
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,986
No, I'm just saying, what kind of
chance do we have...

117
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:17,903
Edgar.

118
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,865
I just think that if this guys says that
he's such a great security expert

119
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:22,950
why can't he just break himself...

120
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,369
That's enough! Go!

121
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,959
Let's go, Tim. Come on. Let's go.

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,968
Edgar just wants to help, you know.
He thinks the world of you.

123
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:45,639
He shouldn't worship me the way he does.
I'm not who he thinks I am.

124
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,768
Few of us ever are.

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,733
Alright. We're here, Tail Section,
Quarantine Section, Prison Section.

126
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,776
Gate.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,820
Gate.

128
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:58,986
Gate.

129
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,947
Four seconds when all three gates are opened at once.

130
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:06,535
We have four seconds to go through
three gates and bust Nam out.

131
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:09,913
Then Nam gets us the rest of the way?

132
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,627
Our fate depends on this man?

133
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:22,635
Yeah. If we can get him to cooperate,
he can take us all the way to the front of the train.

134
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,306
Very front section.

135
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,016
Yeah.

136
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:36,565
From here right to the front of the train.
Everything in one stroke.

137
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:40,861
We control the engine, we control the world.

138
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,030
Without that, we have nothing.

139
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,700
All past revolutions have failed because
they couldn't take the engine.

140
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,702
What are you saying?

141
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,164
This time, we take the engine.

142
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,667
Then what?

143
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:58,837
We kill him.

144
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,255
Wilford?

145
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,514
You should run the train now, not Wilford.

146
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:12,893
I'm a shadow of my former shadow.

147
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:18,023
My day was decades ago.

148
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,652
How old is Gilliam?

149
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,654
Shut up, Edgar.

150
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,783
And listen, I'm not saying that I want that
to happen, that's not what I'm saying.

151
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,496
What I mean is he will die someday.

152
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,459
And when that happens
you're gonna have to take over.

153
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,505
You're gonna have to run the train.

154
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,633
I'm not a leader.

155
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,974
I don't know. I think you'd be
pretty good if you ask me.

156
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:04,945
Hey, Edgar.

157
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,741
How far back can you remember?

158
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:15,247
- I don't know, like what?
- Your mother. You remember her?

159
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:25,132
I can remember her face, every once in a while...

160
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:29,511
But it's not clear.

161
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,933
Stay down everybody.
Everybody stay in your place.

162
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,518
Don't fucking look at me!

163
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,605
Keep down, keep down!

164
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:48,864
Medical Inspection. All the kids.
All the kids come with me. Just the kids.

165
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,951
All the kids.

166
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,665
Stay back there, ma'am. Just stay back there.
Stay back there. Stay.

167
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,585
Hello, what's this? We have one more.
Yup, come.

168
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:04,229
No, no, all need to go.
Come on.

169
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:06,066
No, no, we don't need to.
There's nothing wrong with him.

170
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,468
It's just a little medical check, sir. You just
stay back there. You just stay back there.

171
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,443
You! Go and check!

172
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:09,236
Don't move! Stay there!

173
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,738
Go, Timmy, go! Go!

174
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,591
That's her baby!

175
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,053
Andy!

176
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:41,226
Give me my son, you fucking bitch!

177
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:44,229
Andy! Andy!

178
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,942
How did you let him throw his shoe?

179
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:59,661
Timmy!

180
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:29,441
At this altitude, we need only 7 minutes.

181
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:16,071
Seven minutes allotted for your speech, sir.

182
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:26,081
This is so disappointing.

183
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,460
No no, we don't need all that.
We've only got seven minutes.

184
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,721
Passengers.

185
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:47,561
This is not a shoe. This is disorder.

186
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:51,314
This is size ten chaos.

187
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:55,610
This. See this. This is death.

188
00:16:56,446 --> 00:17:00,032
In this locomotive we call home,
there is one thing

189
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,201
that between our warm hearts and the bitter cold.

190
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,539
Clothing? Shields? No! Order.

191
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,044
Order is the barrier that
holds back the frozen death.

192
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:18,216
We must all of us, on this train of life,
remain in our allotted station.

193
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:25,223
We must each of us occupy
our preordained particular position.

194
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:35,984
Would you wear a shoe on your head?
Of course you wouldn't wear a shoe on your head.

195
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:40,530
A shoe doesn't belong on your head.
A shoe belongs on your foot.

196
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,408
A hat belongs on your head.

197
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,203
I am a hat. You are a shoe.

198
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,331
I belong on the head. You belong on the foot.

199
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,750
Yes? So it is.

200
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,837
In the beginning, order
was prescribed by your ticket.

201
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,674
First class, economy, and free loaders like you.

202
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:04,262
Eternal order is prescribed by the Sacred Engine.

203
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:09,434
All things flow from the Sacred Engine.
All things in their place.

204
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,728
All passengers in their section.

205
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:15,107
All water flowing, all heat
rising pays homage

206
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:24,074
to the Sacred Engine. In its own
par-ti-cu-lar pre-ordained position.

207
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,118
So it is.

208
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,749
Now, as in the beginning, I belong to the front.

209
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:37,087
You belong to the tail.

210
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:44,302
When the foot seeks the place of the head,
a sacred line is crossed.

211
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,638
Know your place!

212
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,723
Keep your place!

213
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,476
Be a shoe!

214
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,861
We have 42 seconds left.

215
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:04,239
So we could go to a comment of Mr. Wilford,

216
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:07,576
the Divine Keeper of the Sacred Engine.

217
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,413
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

218
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,082
Are you there?

219
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:24,467
Are you there, sir?
Oh, it's breaking off.

220
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,013
Mr. Wilford is a very busy man.

221
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,348
So it is.

222
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,368
- Are we just gonna watch?
- Not now.

223
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:52,579
I'm not just gonna fucking sit here...

224
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:28,907
No, I'm alright.

225
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:36,957
Stop. Stop right there. Sit down!

226
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:40,210
Put that useless gun down, put it away.

227
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:45,048
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam. It's a pleasure.

228
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:50,428
You look healthy.

229
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:53,223
He's fine.

230
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,945
Minister Mason, please deliver
a message to Mr. Wilford.

231
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,530
Certainly. What shall I say?

232
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,616
Tell him, he and I need to talk.

233
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,786
Well. You can talk to me.

234
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:18,164
Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here...

235
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,127
Not here. At the front.

236
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,814
Your son will be a hero. Promise.

237
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:44,649
Or daughter, whatever it is.

238
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,609
I got it, I got it.

239
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:51,823
Your contribution has been duly noted. Thanks.

240
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:56,828
So sorry to interrupt you while you're praying.

241
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:57,996
What are you doin', man?

242
00:21:58,164 --> 00:21:59,247
So sorry. <i>Sumimasen.</i>

243
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,709
Look. There's your Buddha back, thanks very much.

244
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:08,631
Move, move, move!

245
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,302
Stop fooling around!

246
00:22:40,164 --> 00:22:41,956
I've got a better batch.

247
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:46,711
Stronger, fresh, uncut.
Wanna try some?

248
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:50,924
How many protein blocks for
ten rocks of uncut Kronole?

249
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:01,643
They don't have bullets.

250
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:04,104
Why do you say that?

251
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,817
You remember what Mason said?
She said, "Put down that useless gun."

252
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:13,780
She meant she wouldn't
give the order to shoot me.

253
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:15,782
No.

254
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:18,660
No, I think the guns are literally useless.

255
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:22,539
They used up all their bullets
four years ago, in the last revolt.

256
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,543
Bullets are extinct.

257
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:31,756
If you're wrong, we could be finished
before we even start.

258
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:37,929
I think we should be patient.
Wait for the next red letter.

259
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,781
Stay together. Left and right.

260
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:01,453
Not yet. Up, up. Now left, to the left.

261
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:04,914
Good, now forward.

262
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:20,972
Hello, Andrew! Andrew!

263
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:24,726
Wake up, rise and shine.

264
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:28,605
When you dream too much 
of the sun, you forget the trees.

265
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,942
I believe this is your son.

266
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:39,949
I'm, I'm sorry, it's not very good.
It's not my best work, it's a little dark.

267
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:45,455
But if you look very deep into the eyes,
you can see a little bit of hope.

268
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:48,249
What about my boy?
You've got one of Timmy?

269
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:53,213
Oh yes, Tanya, I do. Easy, easy.
Come off this easy. You'll hurt yourself.

270
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,549
Here, there you go. Timmy.

271
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,680
Look at him.

272
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,351
Funny little smile.

273
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,029
Curtis, you gotta let me come with you.

274
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,739
No, Tanya. I'm sorry.

275
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:22,075
You will be if you don't let me come.

276
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:25,578
I'm going to the front and I'mma make that
bitch sorry she put her hands on my boy.

277
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,330
Make this one tighter.

278
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,543
You know I'm stronger than
all these skinny ass soldiers anyway.

279
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:36,548
Please!

280
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:40,760
Oh shit, what's going on?

281
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,720
They changed the schedule, boys. Move it back!

282
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,056
Now or never! They're coming now!

283
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:47,559
Don't panic! Stick with the plan.

284
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:52,230
Hide that! Hide it in your clothes!
Hide your weapons in your clothes!

285
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:58,444
Head check.

286
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:02,365
Line up.

287
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:08,121
Alright, sit down.

288
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:13,209
One, two, three, four...

289
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:14,836
What the fuck do we do?

290
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,716
I've had enough of this protein block bullshit!

291
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,134
Yeah, this is bullshit!

292
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:22,093
We're fucking hungry, man!

293
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:23,595
I want chicken!

294
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,119
We're not gonna sit down for this shite!

295
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:29,259
We want chicken! Chicken!

296
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:37,025
It's okay.

297
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,527
You want him fucking dead? Is that it?

298
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,279
Be quiet!

299
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:44,282
Still going for it, are we?

300
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,162
Come on, let's go! Let's do it.

301
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,294
The rifles.

302
00:26:56,462 --> 00:27:00,131
No, we can overwhelm them.
We easily outnumber their bullets.

303
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,305
This is it.

304
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:11,726
Curtis, come on. We're out of time.
You gotta do it now.

305
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,659
They've got no bullets!

306
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:49,157
I'm fine, Grey. You go now!

307
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:19,687
"Nam Koong Min Soo. Kronole Addict."
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

308
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:20,688
Hurry up, Edgar.

309
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,231
Hurry up?

310
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:27,987
So sorry for keeping you all waiting.
Obviously I work here.

311
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,116
Open it.

312
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,367
Here we go!

313
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:50,468
Hey, Kronole head!

314
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:56,557
So, this is Kronole?
I heard it's pretty big in the front section.

315
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,976
Careful, that's how these guys hallucinate.

316
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:04,315
It's industrial waste.
And it's highly flammable.

317
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:27,630
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo? Security specialist?

318
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:34,679
Did you design all the door locks
and security systems on the train?

319
00:30:35,597 --> 00:30:39,600
Look at him man, he's gone. Look at his eyes.
He's fried his brain with that fucking shite.

320
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:42,353
Are you Nam?

321
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:03,291
Nam, are you listening?

322
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:10,381
Yes, I'm listening, fuck.

323
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,900
It's not "Nem", it's "Nam".
Namgoong Minsoo, shit.

324
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,500
Surname is Namgoong,
first name is Minsoo, asshole.

325
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:26,522
Unknown words found.
Please try again with correct vocabulary.

326
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:29,859
We need your help.

327
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,485
For what?

328
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:36,616
We're going to the front and
we need you to open up the gates.

329
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,661
What if I say no?

330
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,123
Uncut. Straight from the barrel.

331
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:48,085
Every door you open, you get one lump of Kronole.

332
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:05,728
Jesus! Marlboro Light?

333
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,402
I can't believe it. Cigarettes have been
extinct for more than 10 years now.

334
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,623
Do you want some, asshole?

335
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:30,795
I bet you fuckhead never smoked one before.

336
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:36,133
I'm gonna make this real simple for you.
You help us, you get your drug.

337
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:40,846
If not, we put you back where we found you.
What'll it be, asshole?

338
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,939
Chan.

339
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,650
Chan. Get outta here. Just get out.

340
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,175
Hey, that's enough.

341
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:21,721
Put him back in the fucking drawer!

342
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,658
Get up.

343
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,464
My Daughter, Yona.
If I go, she goes too.

344
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:58,382
So, you're coming with us?

345
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:06,599
One gate, 2 lumps of Kronole.

346
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:09,226
She's an addict, too?

347
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:35,669
Nobody there.

348
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,298
Kronole.

349
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:03,614
Look at all these beds. Where is everybody?

350
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,533
Looks like they left in a hurry.

351
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,994
There's some food on the table.

352
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,293
This can't be a window, can it?

353
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,605
Still cold.

354
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:52,663
Dead. All dead.

355
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:08,095
Alright! Let's go everyone!

356
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:09,972
Stay focus. We didn't come here for this.

357
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,599
Alright! You heard the man. Let's go! Move!

358
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,684
Nem! Nam!

359
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:19,940
Kronole.

360
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:22,234
How did you know there was nobody there?

361
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,196
He's running.

362
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,916
Paul?

363
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:39,293
Paul!

364
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,378
What the hell is he doing, man? Paul!

365
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:42,254
He looks so different.

366
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:47,218
Yeah, just a second. Used to be automatic.
But parts went extinct.

367
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:48,886
He's not the Paul I remember.

368
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,472
No. Paul! It's Curtis!

369
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,059
Ain't comin' back... so now I got to do it.

370
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,562
Manually!

371
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:03,567
So that's how it's made. Still hot.

372
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:08,322
Look at them all! Man, you did some nice work!

373
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,408
That's right, man! There's your food!
There's your protein blocks!

374
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:14,370
Is this why they took you? To make this garbage?

375
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,122
Paul?

376
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,251
You've been alone this whole time?

377
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:25,089
Alone! In the zone!

378
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:29,802
We're going to the front. Come with us!

379
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,263
Oh, right! You're going to the front? Yeah, man!

380
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,933
But, no way man. My place is here. Alright?

381
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:38,727
Here? Making this crap? Why?

382
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,127
You can't draw this.

383
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,462
Okay.

384
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:12,803
All this time, we've been eating this shit?

385
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,389
Hey, I eat them too, you know.

386
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,558
Every single day.

387
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:21,812
Where did you get this?

388
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,190
Have you been the one writing these?

389
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:27,901
I don't write 'em.

390
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,321
Why do you have this? Who gave this to you?

391
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:38,329
They just leave 'em for me ,man. I put them
in the protein blocks. I send them on. That's it!

392
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:44,168
The Water Supply Section?

393
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:50,549
Yeah. It's just a few cars up. It's where
the water's cleansed and recycled.

394
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:53,427
It's one of the most
crucial sections in the train.

395
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:57,014
If we take it, we have the upper hand?

396
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:59,808
We don't even have to
go to the very front.

397
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:05,022
We control the water, we control the negotiation.

398
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:12,780
Uh, hi, hi, excuse me. Sorry to bother you there.

399
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:16,033
Can I get you a glass of water or
something to speed this up?

400
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,706
Listen! Would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all fucking waiting!

401
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,042
Am I?

402
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:26,210
Yeah, you are.

403
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:29,296
Although you've been
fucking smelling that flammable shite,

404
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:33,175
that time is probably a distant
fucking concept for you, isn't it?

405
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,929
Of course, I'm only doing this for Kronole.

406
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:40,474
Here we go again, Kronole this, Kronole that.

407
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:43,250
Christ almighty, man. Do some fucking work!

408
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:46,021
You're the one who gives it to me.

409
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:49,858
Are you a bit thick? That's what you ask for
each time you open a gate!

410
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:53,695
Of course, I'm only doing this for Kronole.

411
00:39:57,033 --> 00:39:59,618
Yona. It's Yona, right?

412
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:02,996
How old are you?

413
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:06,834
Seventeen.

414
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,753
Seventeen. You're a train baby, then?

415
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:13,632
How 'bout you?

416
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:19,972
Seventeen years on Earth.
Seventeen years in the Tail Section.

417
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,101
Earth? What was it like?

418
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,270
I don't remember.

419
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,105
Why?

420
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:32,067
I don't want to remember anything
before I met Gilliam.

421
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:37,906
Yona.

422
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,201
Are you clairvoyant?

423
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,871
Clairvoyant? What's that?

424
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:50,752
Well, you always seem to know what's behind the gates.
Do you see things in your mind?

425
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,145
Don't open it.

426
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:09,521
What?

427
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:12,733
Lock the gate!

428
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,917
Be careful.

429
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,838
Yeah, you too.

430
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:27,117
Team 2 move!

431
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:28,869
Move forward!

432
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:37,414
Passing Yekaterina Bridge!

433
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,332
We're at the bridge, guys!

434
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,251
Ten. Nine.

435
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:44,212
Eight. Seven. Six.

436
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,173
Five. Four.

437
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:49,384
Three. Two. One.

438
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:56,057
Happy New Year!

439
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:59,436
Fucking hate getting old, I fucking hate it.

440
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:04,232
Wilford! Banzai! Banzai!

441
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:09,070
Everybody down!

442
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:10,864
Hang on!

443
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:20,999
Impact!

444
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:28,799
Not yet! A second one!

445
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,843
Stay down!

446
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,444
Nam, what are you doing man? What are you doing?

447
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,905
He's high as a fucking kite.

448
00:46:58,162 --> 00:46:59,746
Here it comes.

449
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:34,489
Safe passage.

450
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:40,704
Hey, watch it! Watch out!
Come on!

451
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:56,511
One, two, three. One, two.

452
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:02,893
Happy Yekaterina Bridge, you filthy ingrates!

453
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:08,231
You people, who if not for the benevolent Wilford,

454
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:12,694
would have frozen solid 18 years ago today!

455
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:15,780
You people...

456
00:48:15,948 --> 00:48:22,245
Who have sucked on the generous titty of Wilford
ever since, for food and shelter!

457
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:30,569
And now, in front of
our hallowed water supply section, no less!

458
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:36,544
You repay his kindness with
violent hooliganism?

459
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:41,473
You scum.

460
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,105
Precisely 74% of you shall die.

461
00:48:55,321 --> 00:49:00,075
My friend, you suffer from
the misplaced optimism of the doomed.

462
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:02,786
This is going to be good.

463
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:13,296
What? What did you say?

464
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:15,674
He said you guys are fucked.

465
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:19,719
You stupid Tail Sectioners.

466
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:25,183
There's a tunnel right after Yekaterina Bridge.

467
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:25,976
A tunnel?

468
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:27,936
Mm-hmm, a fucking long one!

469
00:49:28,104 --> 00:49:29,479
Let's go.

470
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:35,151
Everybody back!

471
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,560
Chan. Get outta here. Just get out.

472
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:58,068
Chan! We need fire!

473
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:00,361
Chan! Bring the fire!

474
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:03,406
Tell them in the back
we need to get the lights up here!

475
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:05,784
Chan has the matches!

476
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,982
Got you, motherfucker!

477
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:43,938
Officer Fuyu! What are you doing?
Don't look at me, you dozy bugger!

478
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:47,281
Look there!

479
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:01,339
Put me down! Stop squeezing my legs!

480
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,566
Surrender!

481
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:26,656
Surrender! Surrender!
He will kill me if we don't surrender!

482
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:31,286
Shit...

483
00:52:57,313 --> 00:52:59,147
Curtis!

484
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:54,953
Stop! Stop everybody!

485
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:56,996
Drop your weapon.

486
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:02,252
Stop!

487
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:04,087
Everybody stop!

488
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:13,513
Do what he says, for crying out loud.

489
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:17,976
Drop your weapons!

490
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:19,537
Don't look.

491
00:56:00,245 --> 00:56:05,416
Survivors! Wash yourselves!

492
00:56:07,753 --> 00:56:10,380
The Water Supply Section.

493
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:15,093
Wash away the blood.

494
00:56:43,247 --> 00:56:45,665
Have you seen these kids?

495
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,584
I don't know anything about...

496
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:55,258
Look! Where are they, you bitch?

497
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:59,595
I don't know. I don't know.
It's not me. It's not me.

498
00:57:00,681 --> 00:57:02,265
Tell us or I'll cut your fucking arm off.

499
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:04,225
Even shorter than mine, you bastard!

500
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:06,811
Wilford... Wilford knows.

501
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:10,606
Wil... Wilford... Wilford likes kids.

502
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:15,862
He does. That's why he sends that
yellow one Claude to get them for him...

503
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:18,698
It... it's Wilford you want, not me.

504
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:21,117
Wilford likes kids?

505
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:24,203
All he cares about is his wretched engine!

506
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:26,247
The Engine is Sacred.

507
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:28,958
And Wilford is Divine.

508
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:32,003
Wilford is merciful.

509
00:57:34,882 --> 00:57:39,051
Call him. See if he'll come save you.

510
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:41,345
Yes.

511
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:45,308
Wilford The Merciful. Call him.

512
00:57:46,268 --> 00:57:49,896
He won't come here. He won't leave his Engine.

513
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:54,066
We're going to rip you into little pieces.
He still won't come?

514
00:57:57,696 --> 00:58:01,449
Well, we control the water.
We turn that off, he'll have to come.

515
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,493
Turn off the water?

516
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:07,663
Well, you'll only be condemning your own people.

517
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,541
The water comes from the front.

518
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:15,546
The nose of the train breaks up the snow
and ice and turns it into water.

519
00:58:15,714 --> 00:58:21,677
It's like an elephant's trunk. The water
comes in the mouth, not in the bum.

520
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:23,054
Curtis!

521
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,850
Yes. Wilford knows you well, Mr. Curtis Everett.

522
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,019
He's been watching you.

523
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:33,564
And we know you won't harm your own people.

524
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:37,193
Too bad you couldn't save
your second in command.

525
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:40,613
- What was his name, Edgar?
- Shut the fuck up!

526
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:42,406
Curtis! Curtis! I can help you!

527
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:44,575
You can fucking die is what you can do.

528
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:47,078
No, I can help you! I swear it!

529
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:48,929
Listen, listen to me!

530
00:58:48,997 --> 00:58:51,582
Wilford won't come here! He's not coming!

531
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,501
You've got to go to him!

532
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:57,046
And I can take you. I know the train.

533
00:58:57,214 --> 00:58:58,589
I can guarantee you safe passage.

534
00:58:58,757 --> 00:59:00,758
Why the fuck would I trust you?

535
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:05,263
Because I want to live.

536
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,183
So you'd sell out Wilford The Benevolent?

537
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:14,814
If I take you to the front,
you have to kill him.

538
00:59:15,524 --> 00:59:20,278
I'll get you close enough.
You kill him and let me live.

539
00:59:27,703 --> 00:59:29,120
Curtis?

540
00:59:37,421 --> 00:59:39,755
You're still determined to push ahead?

541
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:44,760
Of course. We're not even halfway.

542
00:59:47,306 --> 00:59:49,974
You've already gone further than anyone else.

543
00:59:52,477 --> 00:59:55,104
Further than MacGregor four years ago.

544
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:00,318
Ten cars, twenty cars, it doesn't matter
unless we make it to the engine.

545
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,237
They'll just regroup and attack us again.

546
01:00:03,822 --> 01:00:05,865
We gotta pull them out by the roots.

547
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:12,413
But so many have been killed.
We've lost so many.

548
01:00:13,915 --> 01:00:14,957
I know.

549
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:19,337
Have you seen our men? They are exhausted.

550
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:25,968
I told them to wash themselves,
so that I could assess the damage.

551
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:49,325
Let me go ahead.

552
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,586
I've got Mason now.
I can move a lot faster.

553
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:03,798
You stay here with the wounded.
Guard the prisoners.

554
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:07,593
When we take the engine,
I'll call for you to lead us.

555
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:12,848
Stop it, Curtis. Why are you doing that?

556
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:20,022
You know very well that you're already our leader.

557
01:01:21,817 --> 01:01:24,151
You have to accept that now.

558
01:01:30,117 --> 01:01:32,827
How can I lead if I have two good arms?

559
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:57,393
It's faded a lot.

560
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,779
Better to have both arms.
Can't do a lot with one, you know.

561
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:14,660
Especially when you hold a woman.
It's much better to have two arms, wouldn't you agree?

562
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:29,383
When you get to the narrow bridge,
big gate with the W on it.

563
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:34,096
Wilford's behind that.

564
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,893
Don't let Wilford talk.

565
01:02:41,605 --> 01:02:43,105
Cut out his tongue.

566
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,444
Okay, let's all get in there, squeeze in!

567
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:57,077
Perfect, perfect! The hat becomes you well.

568
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:05,336
Now, Grey... You must go with Curtis.

569
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:17,556
Oops, forgot somebody.

570
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,442
Kronole.

571
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:58,264
Don't mind me. Back to work,
everyone, back to work.

572
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:00,391
Minister.

573
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,183
Are you okay?

574
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:02,101
I'm okay.

575
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:03,310
Please don't eat it, don't eat it.

576
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:06,021
No, no, no, no, they're very friendly.
They won't bite.

577
01:04:06,189 --> 01:04:08,399
Well, they might bite the tomato, but...

578
01:04:12,988 --> 01:04:14,488
Can I eat this?

579
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,365
Train baby like you wouldn't know.

580
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,952
I used to walk on this every day.

581
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:23,163
Under the snow this is everywhere.

582
01:04:23,373 --> 01:04:24,373
Earth.

583
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:26,542
What's this?

584
01:04:27,293 --> 01:04:28,418
It's moving.

585
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,379
Over there.

586
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:32,965
What's that?

587
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:55,404
Hey.

588
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:01,577
Do any of you feel like sushi?

589
01:05:01,912 --> 01:05:04,496
Hell yeah, line that shit up.

590
01:05:04,748 --> 01:05:06,081
Right?

591
01:05:10,295 --> 01:05:12,004
You people are very lucky.

592
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:17,426
This is only served twice in a year,
in January and July.

593
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:19,887
Why? Not enough fish?

594
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:22,348
Oh, "enough" is not the criterion.

595
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,391
Balance.

596
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:28,479
You see, this aquarium is
a closed ecological system.

597
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:35,653
The number of individual units must be
very closely, precisely controlled

598
01:05:35,946 --> 01:05:39,615
in order to maintain
the proper sustainable balance.

599
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:22,574
No.

600
01:06:23,326 --> 01:06:24,910
You eat this.

601
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,329
You know what that's made of?

602
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:36,672
Dig in.

603
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:04,908
Curtis, my friend, do you think we might dispense
with the restraints for this next Section?

604
01:07:05,076 --> 01:07:07,703
I am not your friend and why would I?

605
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:11,749
For the sake of the young? Education?

606
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:16,712
Quiet! Quiet!

607
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,547
Good morning, children.

608
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:22,426
I am pleased to present guests from the Tail Section.

609
01:07:22,594 --> 01:07:25,596
Yes and what do we say to
Tail Section guests, children?

610
01:07:25,889 --> 01:07:29,475
Good morning, Tail Section guests.

611
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:31,060
Timmy! Timmy!

612
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:35,564
Andy! Andy! Andrew...

613
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,905
This little boy. His name is Timmy.

614
01:07:43,073 --> 01:07:45,866
This is my son. Please, take a 
good look at the picture!

615
01:07:46,034 --> 01:07:47,076
I saw them!

616
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:48,911
- When?
- Where?

617
01:07:49,162 --> 01:07:51,330
Came through there, went through there.

618
01:07:52,332 --> 01:07:53,999
Is that all, boy?

619
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:55,751
Yes.

620
01:07:57,921 --> 01:07:58,962
Were they crying?

621
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:01,340
No, but they looked like they wanted to.

622
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:05,594
I heard all Tail Sectioners were lazy dogs

623
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,888
who slept all day in their own shit.

624
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:10,682
No, they're very nice!

625
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:14,895
And very just and merciful. So it is.

626
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:18,440
Minister Mason, we were
just about to show a video.

627
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:20,109
Very good!

628
01:08:23,113 --> 01:08:25,322
Wilford!

629
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:30,327
From a very young age, Mr. Wilford's
love of locomotives was apparent.

630
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:34,206
When I grow up, I want to
live in a train. Forever!

631
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:36,458
Forever!

632
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:37,793
His early dreams were realized

633
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:43,465
when he founded his transportation empire
the Wilford Industries.

634
01:08:43,842 --> 01:08:48,095
But his greatest dream was to
construct a luxury locomotive cruise line.

635
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:52,182
Connecting railways of
the entire world into one!

636
01:08:52,475 --> 01:08:56,687
A circular railway that extends for 438,000 kilometers

637
01:08:56,938 --> 01:08:59,314
and completes one circle every year.

638
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:03,944
Impervious to the extreme cold of the Arctic
and the scorching heat of the African desert.

639
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:06,488
Wilford's miracle train is self-sustaining

640
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:10,909
and possesses the most sophisticated designs
and advanced technology known--

641
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:13,078
As hard as it is to believe,

642
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:16,331
people in the Old World made fun of Mr. Wilford.

643
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:22,004
They criticized him for over-engineering
and over-equipping this wonderful train.

644
01:09:22,297 --> 01:09:25,132
But Wilford knew something they did not.

645
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,175
And what was that?

646
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:30,304
Old World people were frigging morons
who got turned into popsicles!

647
01:09:30,722 --> 01:09:33,682
Well, sort of.
Mr. Wilford knew that

648
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,435
CW-7 would freeze the world.

649
01:09:36,603 --> 01:09:42,191
So what did the prophetic Mr. Wilford invent to
protect the chosen from that calamity?

650
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:44,484
The Engine!

651
01:09:44,694 --> 01:09:47,029
Rumble, rumble, rattle, rattle.

652
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:49,698
It will never die!

I love that one, such a tonic.

667
01:10:22,774 --> 01:10:27,945
Oh, it's time, children!
Come this way! Don't trip now!

668
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:30,906
Don't push! There's plenty of room.

669
01:10:31,241 --> 01:10:33,283
Who can tell me what's coming up?

670
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:36,411
The Frozen Seven!

671
01:10:36,579 --> 01:10:39,748
Pay attention. This tableau
will surely be on the exam!

672
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:44,753
Fifteen years ago, in the third year of
the train, seven passengers tried

673
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:48,924
to stop Wilford's Miracle Train and go outside!

674
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,093
And what do we call this event, Magdalena?

675
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:52,970
The Revolt of the Seven.

676
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:55,764
Very good. Long before you were born.

677
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,727
Of course, they failed to stop the train.
Instead, they jumped out of the running train.

678
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:02,938
Here they come now.

679
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:06,775
You look too.

680
01:11:08,861 --> 01:11:10,028
Why?

681
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:13,365
There they are. That's how far they made it.

682
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:20,539
That person in the front...

683
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:25,127
...was a cleaning lady from the front section.

684
01:11:26,296 --> 01:11:30,132
She was an Inuit. You know, Eskimo.

685
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:34,344
She taught me about every type of snow and ice.

686
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,139
She believed we could survive outside the train.

687
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:39,599
If we ever go outside the train?

688
01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:42,811
We'd all freeze and die!

689
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:44,980
If the engine stops running?

690
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:47,482
We'd all die!

691
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:50,777
And who takes care of the Sacred Engine?

692
01:11:51,029 --> 01:11:53,864
Sir Wilford!

693
01:11:54,532 --> 01:11:57,659
Children! It's the New Year eggs from Mr. Wilford!

694
01:11:58,328 --> 01:12:00,495
Touch them, they are still warm.

695
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:05,334
These eggs are boiled using water
heated by the Sacred Engine itself.

696
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:07,961
As a special treat, we have playing for us,

697
01:12:08,171 --> 01:12:12,758
the world-renowned first chair violinist of
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

698
01:12:12,925 --> 01:12:15,093
Mr. Gerald McInster!

699
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:22,851
Is that really Gerald? He looks damn great!

700
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,193
No, thank you very much.

701
01:12:38,951 --> 01:12:40,535
Let's go, Curtis.

702
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:49,628
Happy New Year!

703
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:02,724
I thought the chicken was extinct.

704
01:13:14,737 --> 01:13:17,823
There are actually many things on board
were rumored to be extinct.

705
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,491
Such as?

706
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:23,245
This.

707
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,931
Andrew! No!

708
01:13:56,654 --> 01:13:58,321
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

709
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,374
No.

710
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:35,192
Curtis!

711
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:38,820
You have to lead us.

712
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:53,835
Curtis, my friend.
We understand each other.

713
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:56,129
Listen to my words! It wasn't me!

714
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:16,191
We go forward.

715
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:28,703
Open!

716
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,163
Hurry!

717
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:21,756
It's Mason.

718
01:16:21,924 --> 01:16:23,425
Shit. Check her pulse.

719
01:16:48,618 --> 01:16:50,619
Hey, hey, fire regulation...

720
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:01,981
God, that does not look good.

721
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,709
He's coming.

722
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:36,641
Got the master key, right?

723
01:18:40,688 --> 01:18:42,731
Wait, don't shoot. Please don't shoot.

724
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:21,770
You just killed a Front Section Passenger! I'm...

725
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:26,441
I didn't see a thing.

726
01:19:27,693 --> 01:19:32,071
Where are you going? Wait, just wait a minute!
Can't we talk about it just for one second...

727
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:06,648
You son of a bitch!

728
01:21:34,904 --> 01:21:36,696
Close the door.

729
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:43,805
Tanya.

730
01:22:45,182 --> 01:22:48,267
Oh...

731
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:52,355
My Timmy.

732
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:55,733
My Timmy.

733
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:18,715
We're gonna find him. I promise.

734
01:23:20,843 --> 01:23:22,218
I know.

735
01:23:28,017 --> 01:23:29,517
Thank you.

736
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,455
You grab some too.

737
01:24:41,298 --> 01:24:44,300
<i>Hey, turn around, motherfucker!
You got my Kronole!</i>

738
01:24:44,524 --> 01:24:46,524
<i>I want that shit!</i>

739
01:24:48,348 --> 01:24:50,848
<i>I'm coming after you, man!
I want my Kronole back!</i>

740
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:53,372
<i>That's my Kronole, motherfucker!</i>

741
01:24:58,232 --> 01:25:01,843
<i>I swear, man! I'm gonna kill you, 
you spaced-out fuck!</i>

742
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,049
Open the door.

743
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:54,597
Come on, Kronole.

744
01:26:54,848 --> 01:26:58,559
Kronole? You want Kronole?
Here. Take it.

745
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:02,313
Open it. Open the gate!

746
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,319
You're crazy.

747
01:27:35,973 --> 01:27:38,766
Fucking obsessed with gates.

748
01:27:42,729 --> 01:27:44,522
Here, have a smoke.

749
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:07,420
You should be grateful.

750
01:28:11,508 --> 01:28:15,970
The world's last cigarette, you tail section dick.

751
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:18,681
You ever been to the Tail Section?

752
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:25,396
Do you have any idea what went on
back there? When we boarded?

753
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,029
It was chaos.

754
01:28:36,408 --> 01:28:40,077
Yeah, we didn't freeze to death
but we didn't have time to be thankful.

755
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:43,539
Wilford's soldiers came and they took everything.

756
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:49,378
A thousand people in an iron box.
No food, no water.

757
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:00,681
After a month, we ate the weak.

758
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,822
Do you know what I hate about myself?

759
01:29:20,702 --> 01:29:23,454
I know what people taste like.

760
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,295
I know that babies taste best.

761
01:29:45,268 --> 01:29:51,023
There was a woman. She was hiding with her baby.

762
01:29:53,902 --> 01:30:02,284
Then some men with knives came.
They killed her and they took her baby.

763
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:13,295
And then, an old man...
No relation, just an old man.

764
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:18,300
Stepped forward and he said, "Give me the knife."

765
01:30:20,178 --> 01:30:22,638
And everyone thought he'd kill the baby himself.

766
01:30:24,015 --> 01:30:30,604
But he took the knife, and he cut off his arm.

767
01:30:33,275 --> 01:30:42,491
And he said, "Eat this. If you're so hungry,
eat this. Just leave the baby."

768
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:49,582
I have never seen anything like that.

769
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:56,714
And the men put down their knives.

770
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:03,095
Probably guessed who that old man was.

771
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:10,060
That baby was Edgar.

772
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,359
And I was the man with the knife.

773
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:27,077
I killed Edgar's mother.

774
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:45,221
And then one by one, other people in the
Tail Section started cutting off arms and legs and...

775
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:47,348
...offering them.

776
01:31:48,683 --> 01:31:50,559
It was like a miracle.

777
01:31:57,234 --> 01:32:00,694
And I wanted to.
I tried. I just...

778
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:17,503
A month later, Wilford's soldiers
brought those protein blocks.

779
01:32:17,754 --> 01:32:20,548
We've been eating that shit ever since.

780
01:32:24,886 --> 01:32:27,054
Eighteen years I've hated Wilford.

781
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:35,229
Eighteen years I've waited for this moment.

782
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:43,279
And now I'm here.

783
01:32:59,504 --> 01:33:01,338
Open the gate.

784
01:33:04,175 --> 01:33:05,593
Please.

785
01:33:07,429 --> 01:33:09,805
Thanks for your story, Curtis.

786
01:33:12,142 --> 01:33:14,351
But I don't want to open the gate.

787
01:33:16,104 --> 01:33:18,397
You know what I really want?

788
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:22,693
I want to open the gate.

789
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:28,115
Not this gate.

790
01:33:29,409 --> 01:33:31,118
But that one.

791
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,460
The gate to the outside world.

792
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:43,339
It's been frozen shut for eighteen years.

793
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:46,634
You might take it as a wall.

794
01:33:47,844 --> 01:33:50,220
But it's a fucking gate.

795
01:33:51,806 --> 01:33:55,601
Let's open it and just get the hell out.

796
01:33:56,269 --> 01:33:59,438
And freeze to death? What are you, fucking crazy?

797
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:04,818
What if we don't?

798
01:34:06,446 --> 01:34:08,530
What if we could survive outside?

799
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,160
Remember the Yekaterina Bridge?

800
01:34:14,037 --> 01:34:16,705
When you were being chopped up.

801
01:34:17,749 --> 01:34:21,627
There's something I look at every New Year.

802
01:34:21,836 --> 01:34:25,798
Under the snow is a crashed airplane.

803
01:34:28,426 --> 01:34:34,640
Ten years ago, I could barely see the tail.

804
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:39,269
Now I can see its body and its wings.

805
01:34:42,023 --> 01:34:45,109
There's less ice and snow.

806
01:34:45,443 --> 01:34:48,821
In other words, it's melting.

807
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:53,575
The type of snow that's about to melt.

808
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,744
A little push and it all falls down.

809
01:34:58,289 --> 01:35:00,124
Recently...

810
01:35:01,543 --> 01:35:03,961
...you know what I saw?

811
01:35:06,005 --> 01:35:08,006
Outside the window, there was...

812
01:35:14,013 --> 01:35:17,891
Nevermind. I don't have to tell you this.

813
01:35:18,268 --> 01:35:20,394
You gotta take it easy on that Kronole.

814
01:35:20,645 --> 01:35:23,480
Snorting that flammable
shit's gonna fry your brain.

815
01:35:24,107 --> 01:35:25,733
That's exactly right.

816
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,819
Kronole is originally...

817
01:35:31,406 --> 01:35:33,949
...an industrial waste, highly flammable.

818
01:35:34,576 --> 01:35:36,285
When it's lit, boom!

819
01:35:38,872 --> 01:35:41,957
Simply put, it's a fucking bomb!

820
01:35:46,963 --> 01:35:50,215
I didn't stock up on it for years just to get high.

821
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:53,385
It's to blow up this gate.

822
01:35:54,262 --> 01:35:55,387
Give me the matches!

823
01:35:55,555 --> 01:35:57,097
What the fuck are you doing?

824
01:35:57,557 --> 01:35:58,766
Give it to me.

825
01:35:58,933 --> 01:36:00,768
Take that off the door.

826
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,702
Curtis Everett.

827
01:36:19,621 --> 01:36:24,833
I've been asked to extend a formal invitation from
Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner.

828
01:36:26,753 --> 01:36:28,378
After you.

829
01:36:55,865 --> 01:36:57,991
Curtis! Is that you?

830
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:03,872
Curtis, dear boy. Come in.

831
01:37:07,377 --> 01:37:09,002
Let's take a look at you.

832
01:37:09,671 --> 01:37:14,842
You hungry? You did a man's
work coming all this way.

833
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:18,303
Please sit down.

834
01:37:18,721 --> 01:37:24,601
You are the first human being to have walked
the total length of this train. Tail to Engine.

835
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:29,064
Did you know that? Well done. Bravo.

836
01:37:30,692 --> 01:37:34,695
None of your people have ever been here.
To the engine.

837
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:37,155
I've never been to the Tail Section.

838
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:40,158
Why not? Too dirty for you?

839
01:37:40,702 --> 01:37:43,245
Don't want to rub against
the vermin of the Tail Section?

840
01:37:43,621 --> 01:37:46,415
Do you think my station is
without its own drawbacks?

841
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:50,586
It's noisy. And it's lonely.

842
01:37:53,047 --> 01:37:54,381
Right.

843
01:37:55,049 --> 01:37:58,051
Steaks. Plenty of room.

844
01:37:58,761 --> 01:38:01,054
This whore to bring you anything you want.

845
01:38:01,514 --> 01:38:06,894
Curtis, everyone has their preordained position.
And everyone is in their place except you.

846
01:38:07,896 --> 01:38:11,398
That's what people in the best place
say to people in the worst place.

847
01:38:13,151 --> 01:38:15,903
There's not a soul on this train
who wouldn't trade places with you.

848
01:38:16,154 --> 01:38:17,905
Would you trade places with me?

849
01:38:18,156 --> 01:38:19,406
Fuck you.

850
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:25,495
Curtis, dear boy, the fact is we are
all stuck inside this blasted train.

851
01:38:25,997 --> 01:38:28,624
We are all prisoners in this hunk of metal.

852
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,500
Medium rare?

853
01:38:30,793 --> 01:38:35,881
And this train is a closed ecosystem.
We must always strive for balance.

854
01:38:36,591 --> 01:38:40,218
The air, the water, the food supply,
the population...

855
01:38:40,386 --> 01:38:42,137
...must be always kept in balance.

856
01:38:42,805 --> 01:38:43,847
For optimum balance,

857
01:38:44,015 --> 01:38:48,352
however, there have been times
when more radical solutions were required.

858
01:38:48,519 --> 01:38:54,024
When the population needed to
be reduced rather drastically.

859
01:38:57,487 --> 01:39:00,405
We don't have time for true natural selection.

860
01:39:01,032 --> 01:39:05,410
We would all be hideously overcrowded
and starved waiting for that.

861
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:13,251
The next best solution is to have individual
units kill off other individual units.

862
01:39:14,212 --> 01:39:17,673
From time to time, we've had to
stir the pot so to speak.

863
01:39:18,049 --> 01:39:19,716
The Revolt of the Seven.

864
01:39:20,093 --> 01:39:24,346
The MacGregor Riots.
The Great Curtis Revolution!

865
01:39:25,098 --> 01:39:28,976
A blockbuster production with
a devilishly unpredictable plot!

866
01:39:29,477 --> 01:39:33,313
Who could have predicted your counterattack
with the torch in the Yekaterina Tunnel?

867
01:39:34,232 --> 01:39:38,485
Pure genius. That wasn't what
Gilliam and I had in our plan.

868
01:39:38,653 --> 01:39:39,987
What?

869
01:39:42,699 --> 01:39:47,077
Don't tell me you didn't know.
Gilliam and I. Our plan.

870
01:39:49,163 --> 01:39:50,455
Gilliam?

871
01:39:50,915 --> 01:39:51,873
Gilliam.

872
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:55,043
The front and the tail
are supposed to work together.

873
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:58,839
He was more than a partner, really.

874
01:39:59,882 --> 01:40:00,674
He was my friend.

875
01:40:00,842 --> 01:40:01,842
Bullshit.

876
01:40:02,301 --> 01:40:03,510
I don't believe you.

877
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:09,391
Our original agreement was for
the insurgency to end at the Yekaterina Tunnel.

878
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,688
And all the survivors would go back to
the Tail Section to enjoy much more space.

879
01:40:14,856 --> 01:40:17,899
You're a fucking liar.
Gilliam would never do that.

880
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,527
It all worked out in the end.

881
01:40:20,903 --> 01:40:24,906
Your counterattack actually made
the insurgency ten times more exciting.

882
01:40:25,324 --> 01:40:29,619
Unfortunately, the front suffered
more losses than anticipated,

883
01:40:30,204 --> 01:40:33,165
and Gilliam had to pay the price.

884
01:40:35,877 --> 01:40:37,544
Ironic, isn't it?

885
01:40:37,962 --> 01:40:42,549
How people dramatically cross that
thin barrier between life and death?

886
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:46,178
Now, there is just one last thing for us to do.

887
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,557
Tally up the numbers.

888
01:41:01,611 --> 01:41:03,779
Hello, Wilford. It's me.

889
01:41:04,405 --> 01:41:06,073
I'm at Gilliam's place.

890
01:41:06,365 --> 01:41:07,616
Hold on.

891
01:41:08,076 --> 01:41:09,743
Is it still the same number?

892
01:41:09,952 --> 01:41:12,662
Yes, it still stands at 74 percent.

893
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:14,664
Okay. Carry on.

894
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:16,416
Wait.

895
01:41:16,793 --> 01:41:20,087
Spare eighteen to celebrate our 18th year.

896
01:41:20,296 --> 01:41:23,757
It's a... An excellent idea. Yes.

897
01:41:31,933 --> 01:41:33,100
Your people.

898
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,145
God damn it, Claude. Mind the Engine!

899
01:41:39,107 --> 01:41:41,108
She's getting sensitive recently.

900
01:41:43,236 --> 01:41:44,945
Sit down and mind your table manners.

901
01:41:47,281 --> 01:41:48,615
Just relax.

902
01:41:51,953 --> 01:41:53,495
Calm down.

903
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:57,415
Boy, now I can see what Gilliam meant.

904
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:01,128
He told me you were brilliant and clever,
but always so tense.

905
01:42:02,505 --> 01:42:04,714
When's the last time you got laid?

906
01:42:06,425 --> 01:42:09,636
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

907
01:42:18,646 --> 01:42:20,480
I'll miss Gilliam.

908
01:42:22,066 --> 01:42:24,317
I'll miss our late night phone chats.

909
01:42:25,987 --> 01:42:31,116
He could go on for hours,
all with only one arm!

910
01:42:32,577 --> 01:42:37,122
What's with that face? What's the matter?

911
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:43,503
You look like a crazy person. As if there
aren't enough crazies on this train!

912
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,325
Blood!

913
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:20,832
Are you okay?

914
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,542
What happened?

915
01:43:24,462 --> 01:43:25,795
Get down!

916
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:42,938
Yona.

917
01:43:43,105 --> 01:43:45,190
Open that gate and get the Kronole!

918
01:43:47,151 --> 01:43:49,736
See those wires inside?

919
01:43:50,363 --> 01:43:51,905
Shit, tons of 'em...

920
01:43:53,032 --> 01:43:55,784
Kill! You punk!

921
01:43:56,577 --> 01:44:02,749
I believe it is easier for someone to survive on
this train if they have some level of insanity.

922
01:44:04,835 --> 01:44:06,962
I mean as Gilliam well understood,

923
01:44:07,129 --> 01:44:11,591
we need to maintain a proper
balance of anxiety and fear,

924
01:44:11,842 --> 01:44:13,677
chaos and horror in order

925
01:44:13,844 --> 01:44:15,553
to keep life going.

926
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:20,433
If we don't have that, we need to invent it.

927
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,269
In that sense,

928
01:44:22,436 --> 01:44:25,772
the Great Curtis Revolution
you invented was truly a masterpiece.

929
01:44:26,649 --> 01:44:27,816
Yona!

930
01:44:28,234 --> 01:44:29,442
Red goes into 8!

931
01:44:29,777 --> 01:44:31,236
No, 7!

932
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:38,785
Come with me, Curtis.

933
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:43,123
Something I want to show you.
You deserve it.

934
01:44:46,544 --> 01:44:48,003
Come on.

935
01:44:56,846 --> 01:44:58,805
She's waking up now.

936
01:45:27,209 --> 01:45:30,545
Cozy, yes? Peaceful.

937
01:45:31,505 --> 01:45:33,340
You are now in her heart.

938
01:45:34,717 --> 01:45:37,719
I've devoted my entire life to this.

939
01:45:39,138 --> 01:45:41,097
The Eternal Engine.

940
01:45:43,351 --> 01:45:45,477
It is eternity itself.

941
01:45:49,065 --> 01:45:51,524
Have you ever been alone on this train?

942
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:59,282
When was the last time you were alone?
You can't remember, can you?

943
01:46:00,951 --> 01:46:04,454
So please do, take your time.

944
01:47:04,765 --> 01:47:06,266
I just wrote it.

945
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,269
It's for you, Curtis.

946
01:47:10,438 --> 01:47:11,855
Here.

947
01:47:24,326 --> 01:47:25,743
I am old.

948
01:47:27,288 --> 01:47:32,959
I want you to take my station.
It's what you always wanted.

949
01:47:37,047 --> 01:47:39,090
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

950
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:45,638
You must tend the Engine, keep her humming.

951
01:47:51,812 --> 01:47:55,982
Look, Curtis. Beyond the gate.

952
01:47:57,943 --> 01:48:01,237
Section after section precisely
where they've always been and

953
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:04,991
where they'll always be all adding up to what?

954
01:48:06,952 --> 01:48:08,661
The train.

955
01:48:10,748 --> 01:48:13,291
And now, the perfectly
correct number of human beings

956
01:48:13,459 --> 01:48:17,295
all in their proper places all adding up to what?

957
01:48:17,796 --> 01:48:19,172
Humanity.

958
01:48:19,632 --> 01:48:24,302
The train is the world, we the humanity.

959
01:48:26,347 --> 01:48:30,683
And now you have the sacred responsibility
to lead all of humanity.

960
01:48:31,727 --> 01:48:34,604
Without you, Curtis, humanity will cease to exist.

961
01:48:36,524 --> 01:48:39,150
You've seen what people do without leadership.

962
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,903
They devour one another.

963
01:49:04,385 --> 01:49:06,094
Yona, the Kronole!

964
01:49:10,391 --> 01:49:11,641
Yona, stop!

965
01:49:15,187 --> 01:49:16,563
No bullet?

966
01:49:23,487 --> 01:49:25,572
Put the Kronole on the gate.

967
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:28,074
Look at them.

968
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:31,411
That's how people are.

969
01:49:32,413 --> 01:49:35,290
You know. You've seen this.

970
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:38,418
You've been this.

971
01:49:41,463 --> 01:49:43,548
Ridiculous, pathetic, aren't they?

972
01:49:44,633 --> 01:49:46,968
You can save them from themselves.

973
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:51,389
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

974
01:49:57,396 --> 01:49:58,771
Curtis.

975
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:01,608
This is your destiny.

976
01:50:06,822 --> 01:50:07,488
It's ready!

977
01:50:07,656 --> 01:50:10,408
Curtis has the match!

978
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:15,455
Curtis!

979
01:50:15,664 --> 01:50:17,123
The match!

980
01:50:50,491 --> 01:50:53,159
The space only allows for a very small person.

981
01:50:55,412 --> 01:50:57,330
Young children under five.

982
01:50:57,831 --> 01:51:02,210
The Engine lasts forever
but not so all of its parts.

983
01:51:02,378 --> 01:51:08,800
That piece of equipment went extinct recently.
We needed a replacement.

984
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:14,722
Thank goodness the Tail Section
manufactures a steady supply of kids.

985
01:51:15,683 --> 01:51:17,517
So we can keep going manually.

986
01:51:20,521 --> 01:51:23,022
You fucking bastard!

987
01:51:46,213 --> 01:51:47,797
Yona.

988
01:51:50,175 --> 01:51:51,634
Take the fire.

989
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:11,028
Only one left!

990
01:52:44,271 --> 01:52:46,397
Andy? Is that you?

991
01:52:48,317 --> 01:52:51,652
Andy! You remember me?

992
01:52:52,112 --> 01:52:54,447
Andy, stop! Listen to me!

993
01:52:54,615 --> 01:52:56,949
Don't go up those stairs! Listen!

994
01:52:58,285 --> 01:52:59,952
Andy!

995
01:53:00,704 --> 01:53:02,747
Come here! Come over here!

996
01:53:05,417 --> 01:53:07,043
Andy, listen to me!

997
01:53:07,753 --> 01:53:09,378
Get out of there!

998
01:53:14,092 --> 01:53:16,552
God damn it, Andy, listen to me!

999
01:53:16,762 --> 01:53:21,224
Oh Curtis, don't be so melodramatic.

1000
01:53:22,267 --> 01:53:25,436
You know everyone has
their own preordained position.

1001
01:55:01,658 --> 01:55:02,909
Nice.

1002
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:22,131
Dad! Dad!

1003
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:28,804
Curtis. Curtis.

1004
01:57:39,983 --> 01:57:41,734
Just stay there!
