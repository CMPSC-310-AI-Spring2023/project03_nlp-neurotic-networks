1
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,028
<i>First stage removal. First stage removal.</i>

2
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:42,245
<i>Streets prohibited to non-permits in one hour.</i>

3
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>This conversation with Governor Henry C. Santini...</i>

4
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:06,185
<i>is brought to you by
Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow...</i>

5
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,771
<i>high-energy vegetable concentrates...</i>

6
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,899
<i>and new, delicious Soylent Green...</i>

7
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,527
<i>the miracle food of high-energy plankton...</i>

8
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>gathered from the oceans of the world.</i>

9
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,868
<i>Because of its enormous popularity,
Soylent Green is in short supply.</i>

10
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,621
<i>Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.</i>

11
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>And now, Governor Santini.</i>

12
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,126
<i>Thank you, Richard. Thank you.</i>

13
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>It's a pleasure to be able to talk
to the people of the city of New York.</i>

14
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,756
Bullshit.

15
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,804
Hey. What did you dig up
in those cases I gave you?

16
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,641
Matthewson...

17
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,643
murder.

18
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:52,315
Out of your jurisdiction,
across the city line in Philadelphia.

19
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,318
Chergov, murder.

20
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,904
Went home yesterday.

21
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,324
Donaldson, multiple rape.

22
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,326
Has a record in the Bronx.

23
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,162
Can be extradited.

24
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,831
Get him the hell out of Manhattan.

25
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,625
What about Zolitnikoff?

26
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,501
Well, give me time, will you?

27
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,338
You've been telling me that
for the last three days.

28
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,840
Well, I can't locate the files.

29
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,843
I spent hours on it at the Exchange today.

30
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,679
Talked to every other book
who was there.

31
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,433
You know, there are 20 million guys
out of work in Manhattan alone...

32
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,686
just waiting for my job and yours too.

33
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,522
I want to close that case
and sign it out.

34
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,108
What the hell kind of miracle
do you want of me?

35
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,696
I'm just an ordinary police book,
not the Library of Congress.

36
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,532
I don't know why I bother.

37
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,161
Because it's your job.
Besides, you love me.

38
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,710
- That margarine's turned.
- Son of a bitch.

39
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,716
Zolitnikoff, no record.
Matthewson, no jurisdiction.

40
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:07,098
Chergov, home. And Donaldson, extradite.

41
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,475
Why don't you eat something?

42
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,229
- I'm not hungry enough yet.
- It's not bad.

43
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,525
Tasteless, odorless crud.

44
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,738
You don't know any better.

45
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,743
Oh, for--

46
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,747
You know, when I was a kid...

47
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,624
food was food.

48
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,130
Before our scientific magicians
poisoned the water...

49
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,676
polluted the soil,
decimated plant and animal life.

50
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,762
Why, in my day,
you could buy meat anywhere.

51
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,391
Eggs, they had. Real butter.
Fresh lettuce in the stores.

52
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,435
I know, Sol. You told me before.

53
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,104
How can anything survive
in a climate like this?

54
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,273
A heat wave all year long.

55
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,694
A greenhouse effect.
Everything is burning up.

56
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,739
Okay, wise guy.

57
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,589
Eat some Soylent Green and calm down.

58
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,259
I finished it last night.
I was hungry, damn it.

59
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,221
- I'll hustle some more on Tuesday.
- You do that.

60
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,640
I don't want to get caught in another riot.

61
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,477
Get off. I'll charge up the batteries
before I go.

62
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,981
- You'll get a heart attack.
- I should be so lucky.

63
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,234
I've pedaled this damn thing
halfway around the world.

64
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,779
You know, I'm getting pretty sick of you.

65
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,989
Yes, but you love me.

66
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:52,119
Night shift again. I'll be damn late.

67
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,122
So get something to eat.

68
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,836
- What?
- Go with God.

69
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,505
Schmuck.

70
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,860
Gilbert?

71
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,363
Hey, Mr. Donovan.

72
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,532
I have something for you.

73
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,492
Get inside.

74
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,993
Great.

75
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,638
Handmade, isn't that?

76
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,726
Do you have the words straight?

77
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,354
I won't understand them
if I live to be 100.

78
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,564
You won't.

79
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,900
Okay.

80
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,405
There!

81
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,084
It's good to hear you laugh.

82
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,420
- Come on and play.
- No, thank you.

83
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:29,175
- Thank you for the toy.
- I'm glad it amuses you.

84
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,431
Let me do something for you.

85
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,601
Are you ready, Miss Shirl?
It's getting late.

86
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,769
Go ahead.

87
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,731
According to the inventory,
we're low on everything.

88
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,610
Okay, but I'm gonna bring you a surprise.

89
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,116
I demolished five saucers with one rocket.

90
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,951
Not bad for an amateur.

91
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,539
- I've got your curfew pass.
- Oh, good. I thought I'd lost it.

92
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,848
That makes it 279 D's and 15 cents.

93
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,644
Call it 279 D's even for Mr. Simonson.

94
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,395
Sign it, Brady.

95
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,065
Mr. Brady?

96
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,902
Think I forgot? I didn't forget.

97
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,281
You asked for something special,
and I got it. Come on over here.

98
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:44,250
How often can I offer a customer
something really fantastic?

99
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,960
Look.

100
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,504
Beef, Miss Shirl.

101
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,507
Beef like you've never seen before.

102
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
What do you want?

103
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:35,110
You, Mr. Simonson.

104
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,281
I knew soon.

105
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:49,458
They told me to say
that they were sorry...

106
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,127
but that you had become unreliable.

107
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,967
That's true.

108
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,806
They can't risk a catastrophe, they say.

109
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,058
They're right.

110
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,412
Then...

111
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,023
this is right?

112
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,567
No, not right.

113
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,570
Necessary.

114
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,281
To who?

115
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,161
To God.

116
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,182
I made the routine check.
He was alive at 10:35.

117
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,309
- What was your name again?
- Charles.

118
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,354
- Charles what?
- Just Charles.

119
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,982
It's perfectly legal.

120
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,820
God, we haven't had any trouble here
in years, not years.

121
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,366
The scanners and alarms
went out of order last Thursday.

122
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,453
- Come on. Let's have a look.
- Yes, it was Thursday.

123
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,787
The problem is parts.

124
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,373
The original manufacturer's out of business.

125
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,333
Our men fabricate replacements.

126
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,503
Takes them forever, just forever.

127
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,299
Nothing works, not really.
You can't believe the problems I have.

128
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,886
I'll have to tell the other tenants.

129
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,056
What do I do? Call each of them and say
Mr. Simonson in 22A was slaughtered?

130
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,392
Unit scanner and alarm,
the best there is.

131
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,977
We should have more guards.

132
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,354
- I told management--
- Wait.

133
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,732
We should have more guards.

134
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,986
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.

135
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,407
Tab Fielding. I was Mr. Simonson's bodyguard.

136
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,035
Furniture?

137
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,245
- Yes.
- Simonson's?

138
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,749
- Personal or building?
- Building.

139
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,919
- Where's Simonson?
- In the living room.

140
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,546
Let's go.

141
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,393
- What was his full name?
- William R. Simonson.

142
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,108
Occupation?

143
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,778
- Rich.
- Rich what?

144
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,947
Lawyer. Politics.

145
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,283
I had the impression
he was more or less retired.

146
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,539
Say, does this building
have a food inventory?

147
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,957
Yes, sir.

148
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,959
Wouldn't you know?

149
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,131
Get me some booze.

150
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,968
- That's not within your jurisdiction--
- Relax.

151
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,303
You're not working for him anymore.

152
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,472
Your contract's been canceled.

153
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,058
I've been paid to the end of the month.

154
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,686
Get the bottle.

155
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,157
Your boss didn't put up much of a fight.

156
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,159
He wasn't the type.

157
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,084
- Most people like to live.
- If you say so.

158
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,003
You're a dream.

159
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,922
Bourbon! Son of a--

160
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,684
Hey. Where were you, bodyguard,
when they were butchering your boss?

161
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,853
- He sent us out shopping--
- Us?

162
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,023
The girl and I. You know, Shirl.

163
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,945
So?

164
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,533
Well, we got back at 11.
I saw the jimmy marks on the door and ran in...

165
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,368
but obviously it was--

166
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,879
You know how to write?

167
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,881
Yes.

168
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,134
Why don't you go in the foyer
and write me a statement?

169
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,055
Include all your movements
tonight and yesterday...

170
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,058
and your employment number. Okay?

171
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,809
Okay.

172
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,128
He'd be alive if we hadn't gone out.

173
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,465
Now, you have nothing to regret.
He told us to go.

174
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,301
I think he wanted to die.

175
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:38,140
It was a stupid, amateur burglar.
Nobody's fault, Shirl.

176
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,311
Honey, it wasn't anybody's fault.

177
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,313
Working on your report?

178
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,441
- I was just trying to--
- Yeah, I know.

179
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,944
Hey, what's your name? Shirl?

180
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,612
Yes.

181
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,781
Come on in here a minute, Shirl.

182
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
Come on.

183
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,662
Shut the door.

184
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,631
Let's see your hands.

185
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,306
How many times you been
in trouble with the police?

186
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,807
- Never.
- I can't hear you.

187
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,267
Never!

188
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,020
No fresh bruises.

189
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,273
He didn't knock you around, huh?
You're a lucky girl.

190
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,359
- He never hit me.
- What?

191
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,113
He was a gentle man.
He never abused me.

192
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,491
I wished he'd lived forever.

193
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,035
- Unless you were fooling around.
- No.

194
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,621
- With the bodyguard maybe?
- No, I'm straight.

195
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,414
Ask Charles. I don't cheat.

196
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,541
Come on.

197
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,044
I'd never risk my job.

198
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,963
When you came back,
did you see the body?

199
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,590
Just for a moment.

200
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,093
- Was it like it is now?
- Yes, like it is.

201
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,807
Yeah?

202
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,644
- Sanitation squad is here.
- Just a minute.

203
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,899
What's your arrangement here?

204
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,152
I stay for the next tenant,
if he wants me.

205
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,155
I may have to see you again.

206
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
All right.

207
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,037
Okay, Shirl. That's all.

208
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,763
Thorn, I thought they had you
on riot control.

209
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,098
Right, Wagner.

210
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,433
Hatcher's got you working a double shift?

211
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,768
Me and everybody else.

212
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,812
- No wonder you look lousy.
- Thanks.

213
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,858
- How do you want him marked?
- Simonson. Murder. Dispose.

214
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,611
- They're full up at waste disposal.
- So check dispatch.

215
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,488
Here. You better sign for him.

216
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,371
- My usual cut?
- You'll get your cut.

217
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,707
Just so we understand.

218
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,805
Where are they taking him?

219
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,600
- What's the difference?
- Tell me, please.

220
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,980
He'll be driven outside the city
to a waste disposal plant.

221
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,984
When my grandmother died...

222
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,403
there was a ceremony.

223
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,406
- I remember.
- I know.

224
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,492
You got your report?

225
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,416
What about the death benefit?

226
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,169
We hold it, pending next of kin.

227
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,880
There is no next of kin.

228
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,716
You can file a claim in 30 days.

229
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,509
I was thinking of Shirl.

230
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,012
Sure you were.

231
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,267
Hey, Wagner!

232
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,519
Give me a lift home?

233
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,232
Hey, Sol!

234
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,653
What are you doing home?

235
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,905
What time is it?

236
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,493
Paper.

237
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,205
- New paper.
- Have some pencils.

238
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,419
Did you ever see a cake of soap that big?

239
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:23,675
Courtesy of your next assignment,
William R. Simonson.

240
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,094
Chelsea Towers West.

241
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,516
"Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report...

242
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,644
2015 to 2019."

243
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,314
Two volumes.

244
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,778
- Where in hell did you get all these?
- Off his shelves.

245
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,698
The only reference books he had.
You like them?

246
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,491
I love them.

247
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,787
Do you know how many books
were published once upon a time?

248
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,541
When there was paper and power
and presses that worked and--

249
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,962
What the hell?

250
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
Oh, my God.

251
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,261
This Simonson was a great man.

252
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,403
Love apple.

253
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,284
Isn't that beautiful?

254
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,062
Sol.

255
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,335
Beef?

256
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,509
Oh, my God.

257
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,352
How did we come to this?

258
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,736
Why the hell don't you get out of here?
Go back to your foolish work.

259
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,031
Come on, Sol. Don't take it so big.

260
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,784
Look, we're doing okay.

261
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,619
We're doing fine.

262
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,205
We're doing lousy...

263
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,457
just like when I was a boy.

264
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,377
Nobody cares. Nobody tries...

265
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,462
including me.

266
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,425
I should have gone home long ago.

267
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,719
Come on. I need you.

268
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,766
Simonson, William R.

269
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,572
Number ACX2167D.

270
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:55,160
- 200 D's cash or 250 in food coupons?
- Cash, please.

271
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:59,080
<i>Death benefits, line up
at tables one and two.</i>

272
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:05,378
<i>Death benefits, line up
at tables one and two.</i>

273
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,174
Hey, Callahan, busy house tonight, huh?

274
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,927
So we'll double up the Tuesday riot detail
here at 62nd tomorrow.

275
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,681
That'll leave us thin up here at 101st,
so we'll back up with scoops there.

276
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,391
Got that?

277
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,033
So you finally made it.

278
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,787
- Do you know what time it is?
- You're the one with a watch.

279
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,374
I can't. The damn thing won't run.

280
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,793
Let me see it. Maybe I can fix it again.

281
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,963
Okay.

282
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,304
Oh, let's see. The Matthewson murder....

283
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,890
He's in Philadelphia, out of our jurisdiction.

284
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,558
His wife's been lying.

285
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,479
We'll pick her up if we can find her.
Here. Sign.

286
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,439
Zolitnikoff.

287
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,441
I'm working on it.

288
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,362
Which means you still
haven't got a damn thing.

289
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,076
How old is Sol Roth now?

290
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,497
He's doing all right.

291
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,998
He's had it.

292
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,043
It's time for you to get another book.

293
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,671
- I'll make arrangements.
- No.

294
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,715
- Sooner or later.
- Not now.

295
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,968
Well, it's your job.

296
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,099
Simonson.

297
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,351
Supposed to look like he was killed...

298
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,437
when he caught some punk
burglarizing his apartment.

299
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,441
- Well, what do you say?
- It was an assassination.

300
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,859
Just like that?

301
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,780
One: The alarm system was out of order
for the first time in two years.

302
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,574
Two: The bodyguard was conveniently out shopping.

303
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,287
Three: The punk didn't take anything.
And four: The punk was no punk.

304
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,291
He used a meat hook instead of a gun
to make it look like a punk.

305
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,128
- What did you take?
- Everything I could lay my hands on.

306
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,008
Well, what's for Mother?

307
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,932
One bill for me, 50 for Kulozik, 50 for you.

308
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,518
Ten for Wagner from your end.

309
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,576
- Simonson must have been big.
- How big?

310
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,996
Enough for Chelsea Towers West.

311
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,583
- Who did the inside work?
- For my money, it's the bodyguard.

312
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:54,464
- What about the furniture?
- Like grapefruit.

313
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,633
You never saw a grapefruit.

314
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,927
You never saw her.

315
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,680
Come on. Shove.

316
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,768
- You know what I really think?
- What?

317
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,270
I think it's really busted this time.

318
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:41,969
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybean!

319
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,904
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybean!

320
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,948
Hey! Watch where the hell you're stepping!

321
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,254
What may I do for you, sir?

322
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,591
Thorn, 14th Precinct.

323
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,302
We run a clean building here, Mr. Thorn.

324
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,181
- I want to see Tab Fielding.
- Second floor to the right.

325
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,412
- Who's there?
- Police.

326
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,999
Just a minute.

327
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,298
I'm not dressed!

328
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,933
Let me see your badge.

329
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,434
Open up.

330
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,102
All right.

331
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,109
Detective Thorn, 14th Precinct.

332
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,279
Sorry to make such a racket.
I want to see Mr. Fielding.

333
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,948
He isn't home.

334
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,952
- You Mrs. Fielding?
- I'm Martha Phillips. I live here.

335
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,539
I just met Tab yesterday
in connection with a case.

336
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,208
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask him.

337
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,253
- Would you know where he is now?
- No.

338
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,673
When will he be back?

339
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,467
I don't know. He just left.

340
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,010
Swell.

341
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,720
New furniture?

342
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,515
- I've been with him for four years.
- Furniture?

343
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,850
Yes.

344
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,687
Hey, this is really a terrific place.

345
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,482
That's rice.

346
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,568
Yeah, I've seen it before.

347
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,904
Tab does pretty well for himself, doesn't he?

348
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,324
- He's got a good reputation.
- Who with?

349
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,244
- The people he works for.
- Who's that?

350
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,162
You know, Chelsea West.

351
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,584
Yeah. Well, when he gets back,
tell him Detective Thorn was here. Okay?

352
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,002
Anything you say.

353
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,930
Come on in here a minute, will you?

354
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,515
Sure.

355
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,230
I haven't seen an incinerator for years.

356
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,860
- Used it lately?
- No, it doesn't work.

357
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,529
What does?

358
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,535
Really a nice place you got here.
Really nice.

359
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,206
Plenty of room to move around.

360
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,541
Yeah.

361
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,336
We were very lucky to get it.

362
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:47,423
Sorry I had to bust in like this.
You know? Just routine.

363
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,135
- I haven't been very nice.
- You're just fine.

364
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:54,388
I should have offered you something, Mr. Thorn.

365
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,769
If I'd had the time,
I would've asked for it.

366
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,367
Son of a bitch.

367
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,462
I haven't eaten like this in years.

368
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,048
I never ate like this.

369
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,383
And now you know what you've been missing.

370
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,720
- There was a world once, you punk.
- Yes. So you keep telling me.

371
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,722
I was there. I can prove it.

372
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,353
I know. I know.

373
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:50,564
When you were young,
people were better.

374
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,902
Oh, nuts. People were always rotten.

375
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,738
But the world was beautiful.

376
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,368
It's late.

377
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,246
I gotta get to work.

378
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,665
What have you dug up on Simonson?

379
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,584
I've got a handful of reference work
20 years out of date.

380
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,254
You throw out a name
and you expect a miracle.

381
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,549
Simonson, Sol. Report, huh?

382
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,925
Schmuck.

383
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:24,265
Biographical survey, 2006.
Last one they published.

384
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:28,936
Simonson, William R.

385
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,439
Born 1954.

386
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,900
Evidently unmarried.

387
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,445
Graduated Yale Law School in 1977.

388
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:43,409
Principal partner, Simonson,
Borden and Santini.

389
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:47,663
- Governor Santini?
- Hold still. There's more.

390
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:54,920
In 1997, he was the director of
Holcox Manufacturing, Norfolk, Virginia.

391
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,716
Specialist in manufacturing
freeze-drying equipment...

392
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,093
for commercial food processing.

393
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,473
And in 2018...

394
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,809
Holcox was acquired by Soylent...

395
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,478
and Simonson became a member of the board.

396
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,939
The board of Soylent?

397
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,443
Your dead one was a very important man.

398
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,487
Soylent controls the food supply
for half the world.

399
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,825
- What about those?
- Oh, very technical and highly classified.

400
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,162
Unnumbered copies.
Officially, they don't exist.

401
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,580
Perfect.

402
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,624
- What else do you want?
- Everything.

403
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:36,962
Well, law, Soylent, oceanography--?

404
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,756
Across the board.

405
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,633
Across--? Oh, that's impossible.

406
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,344
Check the Exchange.

407
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,349
Check the Exchange.
I need you to tell me that?

408
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,311
You know, I was a teacher once,
a full professor, a respected man.

409
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:56,982
Make a special effort, will you, Sol?
This case is for real, for a lot of marbles.

410
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,817
- For who?
- Never mind.

411
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:03,822
- Don't forget to pick up the water ration.
- I'll do that. I'll die if I don't get water.

412
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,282
Hey.

413
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,453
- Taste that.
- Taste what?

414
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,622
Taste it.

415
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,672
Strawberries?

416
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,009
Hundred and fifty bucks a jar of strawberries.

417
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,561
Thorn.

418
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:20,566
ID is RC105.

419
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,402
Get me the 14th Precinct.

420
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,698
Thorn, how about paying us a visit?

421
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,451
I can't. I'm following up the Simonson thing.

422
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,830
- Well, what have you got?
- He was a director of Soylent.

423
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,251
- What else?
- Well, right now, somebody's tailing me.

424
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,836
He's damn good at it.

425
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,713
Big deal.

426
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,136
Would you believe bodyguards
are buying strawberries for 150 D's a jar?

427
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,306
You'd better report in here right away.

428
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,601
Yes, sir, first thing in the morning.

429
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,272
That was Thorn.

430
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,774
He's a damn good cop.

431
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,942
Appreciate the difficulty, Ed.

432
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,322
But the department wants to cooperate
with the governor's office, right?

433
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,949
Whatever you say, sir.

434
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,334
It looks like a fair-complected man...

435
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,961
maybe someone close to you, a protector.

436
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,423
And if we refer back
to this card back here...

437
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:30,511
if you look at it, the time sequence
indicates a three-month period.

438
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,639
The cards indicate a secure trend
should follow shortly.

439
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,683
So things are looking up a bit, Kathy.

440
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,499
Thank you.

441
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,629
- Your hair looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

442
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,850
Who is it?

443
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,936
Thorn. Detective Thorn.

444
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,860
I had a few more questions
I wanted to ask.

445
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,868
Having a party?

446
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,453
Just my friends.

447
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,250
It's okay.

448
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,712
Ice.

449
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,256
Jeez.

450
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,717
That's great.

451
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:04,563
It's still over 90 out there.

452
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,987
Hey.

453
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,749
You know, if I had the money,
I'd smoke two, three of these every day.

454
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,754
Come on in here.

455
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,770
On the bed.

456
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:53,111
This is a nice place,
the way it's fixed up.

457
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,032
Perfume.

458
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,828
He was murdered, you know. Assassinated.

459
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,665
Robbery had nothing to do with it.

460
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,793
You understand?

461
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,962
Yes.

462
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,007
- Did he have any relatives?
- I never heard of any.

463
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,802
- Do you know who he worked for?
- No.

464
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,973
- You were with him for three years.
- He never talked about his work.

465
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,267
Did you meet his friends?

466
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,852
Sure, I met some of his friends.

467
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,521
What were their names?

468
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:31,858
- I was never really introduced, you know.
- Oh, come on, Shirl.

469
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,321
Well, there was a Mr. Lempeter...

470
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,491
a man called Tompkins...

471
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,202
and somebody called Santini.

472
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,039
That's all I remember.

473
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,209
He didn't bring people up here very often.

474
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,172
Santini's the governor.

475
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,508
So?

476
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,595
Where did you go with Simonson?

477
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,683
No place.

478
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,104
Shopping once in a while.

479
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,315
- Except--
- Except?

480
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,317
He took me to church.

481
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,901
Church?

482
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,114
About a month ago, and then again
a few days before he died.

483
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,200
What did he do there?

484
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,578
He prayed.

485
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,581
And he talked to a priest.

486
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:28,915
That's about all.

487
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,085
- Why would he take you to church?
- He didn't say.

488
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,546
Why do you think?

489
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:38,216
I think he just wanted
to have somebody along.

490
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,845
He was very strange towards the end.

491
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,058
He didn't touch me for months.

492
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:51,271
And sometimes for no reason at all,
he'd start to cry.

493
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,648
I saw him cry more than once.

494
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,861
Old people do that.

495
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,654
Do they?

496
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,784
I can't figure this Simonson.

497
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:09,915
If I was like him, rich, important...

498
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,751
plenty to eat...

499
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,462
real bourbon...

500
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,172
and a girl like you...

501
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,926
you wouldn't see me in church.

502
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,971
What are you doing here?

503
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:28,892
I've been looking all over the building for you.
I'll teach you to break my rules!

504
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,437
Furniture stays in units!

505
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,607
I've told you before.

506
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,777
- No!
- I mean it!

507
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,321
- I'll get rid of the whole--
- Hold it!

508
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,830
I didn't know you were here, Mr. Thorn.

509
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,962
We give them a day off a month.
We don't have to.

510
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,215
And they break every regulation in the book.

511
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,768
You'd think they'd be grateful for
what they've got here. Wouldn't you?

512
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,356
I'll tell you, Charlie...

513
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,526
they're here because
I called them for questioning.

514
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:23,864
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

515
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,867
Don't you believe me, Charlie?

516
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,371
You should have told me.

517
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,373
Why?

518
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,834
Regulations.

519
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,045
You wanna file a complaint?

520
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,343
What do you say, Charlie?

521
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,181
No.

522
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:54,060
I don't want to do anything unfriendly
like that, Mr. Thorn.

523
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:00,025
I wonder if any of these girls
want to file a complaint against you.

524
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,279
Maybe not.

525
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,532
Maybe they want to keep it friendly.

526
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,076
I hope so.

527
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,787
Don't you, Charlie?

528
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,917
Don't you?

529
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,211
Yes.

530
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,087
Get the hell out of here.

531
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,688
Look, maybe we better all go.
Come on.

532
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,273
Come on.

533
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,817
Come on, baby.

534
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,254
Charles isn't as bad as some.

535
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,130
Don't you ever get mad?

536
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,424
What for?

537
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,643
I left my stuff in here.

538
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,104
It's still dark.

539
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,815
You could stay a while.

540
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,150
You could wash up.

541
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,819
I'll make you breakfast.

542
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,280
Why should you?

543
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,449
There's plenty of food in the refrigerator.

544
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:35,370
Charles wouldn't dare make trouble
for you now.

545
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,667
I got work.

546
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,629
I don't wanna be alone.

547
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,009
I'm frightened when I'm alone.

548
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,804
There's nothing I can do for you, furniture.

549
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,806
I got nothing to give.

550
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,517
The new tenant is coming
to look over the place.

551
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,102
He may not want me.

552
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:04,441
Well, I got a place,
but it's nothing like this.

553
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,654
This is like my home.

554
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,825
I've been here a long time.

555
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,706
You could take a shower
and let the water run as long as you like.

556
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,508
You got....

557
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,553
You got hot water here.

558
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,805
Very hot.

559
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,017
Jeez!

560
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,521
I haven't had a hot bath....

561
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,566
I'll rub you down afterwards.

562
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:54,366
All right.

563
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,910
You turn that air conditioner on
all the way.

564
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,747
All the way up. We'll make it cold,
like winter used to be.

565
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,584
- What about breakfast?
- Anything you like.

566
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:06,544
- Strawberries.
- An egg.

567
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,381
- No, strawberries.
- I've never seen strawberries.

568
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,677
All right. An egg then.
Who the hell needs strawberries?

569
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,560
Mommy! Mommy!

570
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:11,609
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

571
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,405
- Hey, Sister.
- Mommy!

572
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,658
Mommy! Mommy!

573
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:23,121
- Where's the priest?
- You'll find him over there.

574
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,366
Thorn, Father, 14th Precinct.

575
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,870
My name is Paul.

576
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:07,707
Have I done something?

577
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:12,086
No, I'm investigating the murder
of Mr. William Simonson.

578
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,215
- Who do you say?
- Simonson.

579
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,843
Quite an important man, a rich man.

580
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,845
I have no recollection.

581
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,722
- You talked to him.
- Did I?

582
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,225
No doubt about it.

583
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,230
A rich man.

584
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,107
Yes, I remember.

585
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,570
We don't see rich people here anymore.

586
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:41,115
There isn't even enough room for the poor.

587
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,618
There's just too many.

588
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,411
Far too many.

589
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,831
- Fa--
- My memory's eroded.

590
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:53,878
Chiefly, I assign space to people
who need space.

591
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,257
Do you need some space?

592
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,260
I need to know what he said to you.

593
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,928
- Are you sure he's dead?
- Yes.

594
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,429
- Really dead?
- He's dead.

595
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,725
- What did he talk to you about?
- Come back tomorrow. I'm very tired.

596
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,769
Father.

597
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,438
Father, did you hear his confession?

598
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:16,609
There should be a requiem mass,
but there's no room.

599
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,696
- Should I make room?
- This is very important.

600
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,906
I can't help you.

601
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,660
Forgive me. It's destroying me.

602
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,788
- What is?
- The truth.

603
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,124
The truth Simonson told you?

604
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,293
- All truth.
- What is it?

605
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,630
What did he confess?

606
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,053
Sweet Jesus.

607
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,909
- We're closing the Simonson case.
- The hell you say.

608
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:11,331
You heard me. The Simonson case is officially closed.
Felonious assault. Sign.

609
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,584
Yesterday you agreed it was assassination.

610
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,922
There's been 137 reported murders since then,
and we won't solve them either.

611
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,007
I'm not gonna falsify that report.

612
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,093
Got a suspect?

613
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,345
I've got leads.

614
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,849
This isn't somebody you scratch
after 24 hours and forget.

615
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:33,186
I told you there's been a tail on me.

616
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,313
Something stinks here.

617
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:40,318
- Look, you'll sign this, and I'll bury it.
- Like hell you will.

618
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,113
A member of the board of the Soylent Corporation...

619
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,199
was torn apart with a meat hook!

620
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,535
You can't sweep that carcass under the rug.
Who bought you?

621
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,621
You're bought when they pay you a salary.

622
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,872
Who's they?

623
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,709
High and hot. They want this case
closed permanently! Sign this!

624
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:57,961
You sign it!

625
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,881
If I close and somebody higher and hotter
wants to know why, it's my job!

626
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,549
Sign it. I'll cover for you.

627
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:08,554
I won't put my job on the line for you, Hatcher.
Not my damn job!

628
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,312
Hey, big shot.

629
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,982
Hatcher says you're on riot control.

630
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,568
Great. That really makes my day.

631
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,739
This was once called Gramercy Park.

632
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,867
Now it's the only tree sanctuary
in New York.

633
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,996
Governor. Sorry to disturb you this way, sir.

634
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,081
Not at all, Donovan. Not at all.

635
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,167
Your secretary told me where to find you.
It's urgent...

636
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:42,422
- or I wouldn't have come out here.
- I understand.

637
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,925
Now, what is it?

638
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,012
I'm to inform you the board
is determined to resolve...

639
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,681
the Simonson investigation immediately, sir.

640
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,017
- I thought it was resolved.
- Yes, sir.

641
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,770
But the police officer involved
refuses to close the case.

642
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,190
Perhaps because he went to church yesterday.

643
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,485
- What does that mean?
- It was Simonson's church.

644
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,613
The cop spoke 20 minutes with the priest.

645
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,532
So?

646
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,452
The same priest who heard Simonson's confession.

647
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,787
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

648
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,790
I can't hear any more about it.

649
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,209
Just do what you have to do.

650
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,073
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

651
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,077
It has been six months
since my last confession.

652
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,097
A real bargain, folks. Synthetic footgear.

653
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,349
Plastics. Plastic ware.

654
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,268
We have a large assortment of plastic ware.

655
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,438
Some are a little chipped.
Others have hardly any cracks.

656
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:27,401
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybeans.

657
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:34,283
Soylent crumbs! Two D's a kilo.
Nothing cheaper in the market. Come and get it.

658
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:37,620
Soylent buns!
Get your genuine Soylent buns!

659
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:45,503
Keep moving right along.
Soylent Green. Soylent Green right here.

660
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,053
They gave me a quarter of a kilo.

661
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:59,058
I stood in line the whole lousy day,
and they gave me a quarter of a kilo!

662
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,561
Do you believe that?

663
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:06,524
Let me go! Are you gonna put up with this?

664
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,506
They're running out of the damn green.

665
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,343
- Idiots.
- Some foul-up at transport.

666
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:37,096
- This crowd will blow.
- I know.

667
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:41,017
Got the scoops standing by,
but I don't know if they can handle this.

668
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,436
When you gonna make the announcement?

669
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,813
As soon as I get up the nerve.

670
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,441
About five minutes, I guess.
Better pass the word.

671
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,443
Right.

672
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,284
This is the police.

673
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,870
This is the police. This is the police.

674
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,125
I am asking you to disperse.

675
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,503
The supply of Soylent Green
has been exhausted.

676
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,507
You must evacuate the area.

677
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,718
The scoops are on their way.

678
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,304
The scoops are on their way!

679
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:22,350
I repeat: The scoops are on their way.

680
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,810
Today is Tuesday!

681
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,773
Why would you leave that door open?

682
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,072
Mr. Fielding.

683
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,702
- Why did you set up Simonson?
- I didn't.

684
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,372
You're all there is.

685
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,044
- Who pays your bills?
- I do.

686
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:47,346
Oh, no. I won't hit a cop. Bastard.

687
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,515
Yeah, I know.

688
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,123
You get life for that, jerk!

689
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:18,919
Life in a waste disposal plant
in a Soylent factory someplace.

690
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,473
How about that big, fat Soylent Corporation?

691
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,726
Do you work for them like Simonson did?

692
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,103
How much did they pay you for that one?

693
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,355
Does Soylent buy your strawberries?

694
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,984
Anybody tails me, bothers me one more time...

695
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:46,655
I'll come back here and kill you both.
Got it?

696
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,117
Get off my back!

697
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,794
Thorn.

698
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,506
I was worried about you.

699
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,259
- What happened?
- Never mind.

700
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:11,680
It doesn't matter.

701
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:46,674
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.
- Good evening.

702
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,925
Thank you.

703
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,900
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Roth.

704
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,986
- Mr. Roth.
- Evening.

705
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,529
Good evening, Your Honor.

706
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:11,740
I assume you have a priority police problem.

707
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:16,370
Yes, Your Honor.
It's about William Simonson.

708
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,747
And...

709
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,166
these.

710
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,765
Thorn.

711
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:40,603
Thorn. It's curfew.

712
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,898
How do you feel?

713
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,943
A lot better.

714
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,612
I did the best I could...

715
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,698
but I still think you should go see
the police doctor.

716
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,075
He might relieve me from duty.

717
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,036
You need a rest.

718
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,039
More than two days, and I lose my job.

719
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,083
- We could go to another city.
- What for?

720
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,210
They're all like this.

721
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,630
- The country?
- That's not allowed.

722
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,466
Those farms are like fortresses.

723
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,052
- Why?
- Good land's gotta be guarded...

724
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,721
the way they guard
the waste disposal plants...

725
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,058
and Soylent factories and the plankton ships.

726
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:23,562
You know, there are idiots in this world
who wanna take everything we've got.

727
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,776
- Maybe Simonson was one of them.
- I don't believe it.

728
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,280
It means there's no place for us to go.

729
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,449
That's right.

730
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,743
Why should we?

731
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,500
You be careful now.

732
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,502
Keep the scanners on.

733
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,088
Don't go anyplace without a bodyguard.

734
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,091
The new tenant comes tonight.

735
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,760
He'll like you.

736
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:59,264
You're a hell of a piece of furniture.

737
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,267
Don't talk to me like that.

738
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,563
Please.

739
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,775
Okay.

740
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,990
It's horrible.

741
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,868
You must accept it.

742
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,372
I see the words, but I can't believe them.

743
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,083
Believe.

744
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:29,169
The evidence is overwhelming.

745
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,508
- Simonson was a member of the board.
- Yeah.

746
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:39,847
He learned these facts,
and they shook his sanity.

747
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,725
The corporation knew...

748
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:47,062
he was not reliable anymore.

749
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,315
They feared he might talk...

750
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,901
and so he was eliminated.

751
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:58,532
- Then why are they doing this?
- Because it's easier.

752
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,911
I think "expedient" is the word.

753
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:08,625
What we need is the proof
of what they are doing...

754
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:12,379
before we bring it
to the Council of Nations.

755
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,550
Good God.

756
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,762
What God, Mr. Roth?

757
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,891
Where will we find him?

758
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,227
Perhaps at home.

759
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,692
Yes, at home.

760
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:54,880
I waited two whole damn years for an apartment
to open up in this building.

761
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,216
It's a nice place.

762
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:06,433
- How long have you been here?
- A long time.

763
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,937
How old are you?

764
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,730
Twenty-one.

765
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,942
Charles said you were 24.

766
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,693
That makes us both liars.

767
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,408
All right.

768
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,617
All right.

769
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:27,496
I sleep late.
I like a big breakfast and no lunch.

770
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,289
I'll organize the dinner menu.

771
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,583
Three or four times a week,
I have guests.

772
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,837
Sometimes it's business,
and then we have to be alone.

773
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:39,424
Sometimes it's fun,
and then we like a girl who's fun.

774
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:42,719
Are you fun?

775
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,366
May I help you, sir?

776
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:12,291
- It feels good.
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?

777
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,839
And your favorite color?

778
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,008
Orange, I guess.

779
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,218
- Music?
- Classical.

780
01:11:05,986 --> 01:11:10,182
- Light classical.
- I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

781
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,104
Sign here, please, Mr. Roth.

782
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:21,360
- A full 20 minutes?
- Oh, certainly. Guaranteed.

783
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,615
Thank you.

784
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,912
This way, please, Mr. Roth.

785
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,541
Good evening, ma'am.
May I have your name, please?

786
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,129
Well, I see that orange
is your favorite color.

787
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,634
- You want Mr. Solomon Roth?
- That's right.

788
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,970
This way, please.

789
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,329
My God.

790
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:41,249
It's truly unfortunate
that you missed the overture.

791
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:58,100
- I want to see him.
- That is prohibited during the ceremony.

792
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,559
Well, I can assure you--

793
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:02,062
Open that damn thing right now...

794
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,606
or I swear to God
you'll die before he does.

795
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,068
All right! All right.

796
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,661
Sol, can you hear me?

797
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,041
- <i>Thorn?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

798
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,792
Thank you for coming.

799
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,839
- <i>Oh, dear God.</i>
- I've lived too long.

800
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,675
<i>No.</i>

801
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,595
I love you, Thorn.

802
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:04,309
I love you, Sol.

803
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,113
Can you see it?

804
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:20,659
Yes.

805
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,204
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

806
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,249
Oh, yes.

807
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,840
I told you.

808
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,636
How could I know?

809
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,681
How could I?

810
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,268
How could I ever imagine?

811
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,384
Horrible.

812
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,305
Simonson.

813
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,392
Soylent.

814
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,981
Listen to me, Thorn.

815
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,733
Thorn, listen.

816
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,824
I can't hear him.

817
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,410
Do something, damn it!

818
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,584
Yes, Sol.

819
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:07,307
<i>You've got to prove it, Thorn.</i>

820
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,977
<i>Go to the Exchange.</i>

821
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,605
<i>Please, Thorn.</i>

822
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,861
You've got to prove it, Thorn.

823
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,489
The Exchange.

824
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,240
Go to....

825
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,412
Hey!

826
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:25,865
- <i>Dispatch.</i>
- Thorn, ID RC105.

827
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,492
Get me the 14th Precinct. Urgent.

828
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,578
<i>Just a moment.</i>

829
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:33,748
- <i>The circuit is in use.</i>
- Well, break in!

830
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:36,792
<i>It's a 6-1 priority.</i>

831
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:41,672
Look, get me Chelsea Towers West.
Apartment 22A.

832
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,675
- Cut in if you get the 14th.
- <i>Understood.</i>

833
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,185
- Hello?
- Shirl, it's me.

834
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,772
Oh, Thorn, I'm so glad.
I have to talk to you.

835
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,358
No, there's no time.

836
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,195
- The new tenant wanted me.
- Good. Stay with him.

837
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,530
I want you to stay with him always.

838
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,908
Oh, Thorn, I want to live with you.

839
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,160
Just live.

840
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:13,621
- <i>I have Lt. Hatcher.</i>
- Plug him in.

841
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,289
Thorn?

842
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,707
Thorn.

843
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:21,045
- Thorn, where the hell have you been?
- <i>I'm at the Exchange.</i>

844
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,633
Hatcher, help me.

845
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,487
There's another one over there.

846
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:04,787
- Hey, punk, are you with us?
- Hatcher.

847
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:09,333
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, you got him, all right.

848
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:12,503
You don't listen too good,
but you're a damn good cop.

849
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,296
Hatcher...

850
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:18,509
get to the Exchange.

851
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,470
You gotta tell them they're right.

852
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,515
But let's take care of you first.

853
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:29,103
You don't understand.

854
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,188
I've got proof.

855
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:33,816
They need proof.

856
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,361
I've seen it. I've seen it happening.

857
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,364
They've gotta tell people.

858
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:46,870
- Tell them what?
- The ocean's dying. Plankton's dying.

859
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:50,249
It's people.

860
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:56,672
Soylent Green is made out of people.

861
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,649
They're making our food out of people.

862
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:19,903
Next thing, they'll be breeding us
like cattle for food.

863
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,656
You've gotta tell them.
You've gotta tell them.

864
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,534
I promise, tiger. I promise.
I'll tell the Exchange.

865
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,536
You tell everybody.

866
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:30,581
Listen to me, Hatcher.
You've gotta tell them!

867
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:34,209
Soylent Green is people!

868
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:38,339
We've gotta stop them somehow!

869
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:46,008
