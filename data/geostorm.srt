1
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,940
<i>Everyone was warned,
but no one listened.</i>

2
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,890
<i>A rise in temperature...</i>

3
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,890
<i>Ocean patterns changed...</i>

4
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,890
<i>And ice caps melted.</i>

5
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,690
<i>They called it extreme weather.</i>

6
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,450
<i>They didn't know what "extreme" was.</i>

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,970
<i>In the year of 2019...</i>

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,890
<i>Hurricanes...</i>

9
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,330
<i>Tornadoes...</i>

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,850
<i>Floods...</i>

11
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,240
<i>And droughts...</i>

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,340
<i>Unleashed a wave of destruction
upon our planet.</i>

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,930
<i>We didn't just lose towns...</i>

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,450
<i>Or beachfronts.</i>

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,300
<i>We lost entire cities.</i>

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,410
<i>The East River swallowed
Lower Manhattan.</i>

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>A heat wave killed two million people
in Madrid...</i>

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,660
<i>In just one day.</i>

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,010
<i>But in that moment...</i>

20
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,690
<i>Facing our own extinction...</i>

21
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,930
<i>It became clear that no single nation
could solve this problem alone.</i>

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>The world came together as one...</i>

23
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,690
<i>And we fought back.</i>

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,130
<i>Scientists from 17 countries...</i>

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,730
<i>Led by the U.S. and China...</i>

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,970
<i>Worked tirelessly.</i>

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,650
<i>Not as representatives
of their nations...</i>

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,130
<i>But of humanity.</i>

29
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,010
<i>They found a way
to neutralize the storms...</i>

30
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,050
<i>With a net of thousands of satellites,</i>

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,930
<i>each deploying countermeasures designed
to impact the basic elements of weather,</i>

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,050
<i>heat, pressure, and water.</i>

33
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,410
<i>All overseen
by the International Space Station.</i>

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,490
<i>They gave the satellite net
a technical name...</i>

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,770
<i>But we all came to call it Dutch Boy...</i>

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,730
<i>After the story of the child
who plugged a dam with his finger.</i>

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,130
<i>This is what saved us all.</i>

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,500
<i>And it was built by a team
led by one man...</i>

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,890
<i>My father.</i>

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,250
- Thank you.
- Keep the change.

41
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,810
Jake Lawson. I have a Senate--

42
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,130
Senate hearing in room 12.

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,290
Yeah.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,490
Lawson?

45
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,330
- You're the Dutch Boy guy, right?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,720
Man, I need to shake your hand.

47
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,130
Oh. Okay.

48
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,290
Tornado? Zap!

49
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,210
Blizzard? Zap!

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,330
Monsoon?

51
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,690
- Zap?
- Zap!

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,530
Everybody down here owes you,
Jake Lawson.

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,210
If you need anything, you just ask.

54
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,210
<i>The Senate Committee
assigned to oversee Dutch Boy</i>

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,890
<i>will now hear from Jacob Lawson...</i>

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,170
<i>Climate ISS Chief Operations
Coordinator.</i>

57
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,730
<i>May the record reflect
that he was nearly one hour late.</i>

58
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,170
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,410
<i>I literally had to
fly in from outer space.</i>

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,250
Oh, here we go.

61
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,530
<i>Mr. Lawson, we find ourselves
heading toward a crossroads.</i>

62
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,610
<i>As you know, as per
UN Resolution 28-14,</i>

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,450
<i>the United States will be
handing over control of Dutch Boy</i>

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,850
<i>to an International Oversight Committee
in three years.</i>

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,970
<i>This in spite of the fact
that we actually built the thing.</i>

66
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,330
<i>Excuse me, Senator.
I don't wanna slow things down.</i>

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,060
<i>You said "we" built it?</i>

68
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,890
<i>Yes, indeed, I did.</i>

69
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,330
<i>Because I know what I did. I'm the guy
who led the team that built the station.</i>

70
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,010
<i>I was up there with an international
crew of 600 people, not just Americans.</i>

71
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,290
<i>And I know all of their faces,
but I don't remember yours.</i>

72
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,330
<i>We had a plumber up there.
He looked a little like you.</i>

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,570
<i>Very clever, Mr. Lawson.</i>

74
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,330
<i>Dutch Boy was an international effort</i>

75
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,050
<i>and, yes, it may, one day, very well...</i>

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,330
<i>...belong to the world.</i>

77
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,770
<i>But until it does,
we have authority over its operation</i>

78
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,210
<i>and we have authority over you!</i>

79
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,690
<i>And you have been flouting
that authority.</i>

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,530
<i>I have report after report here.</i>

81
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,050
<i>Failure to follow procedures...</i>

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,250
<i>Numerous violations
of the chain of command.</i>

83
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,570
<i>Then, there was the incident where you
punched a federal inspector in the face.</i>

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,530
<i>Well, your federal inspector
doesn't know</i>

85
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,490
<i>that a capacitor holds a charge
even when it's disconnected.</i>

86
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,330
<i>He was grabbing for the damn thing.
I saved his life!</i>

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>You can make all the excuses
you want, Mr. Lawson,</i>

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,650
<i>but there's one thing you cannot defend.</i>

89
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,770
<i>And that would be the day
you brought Dutch Boy online...</i>

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,090
<i>...and operational without our consent!</i>

91
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,610
<i>And what would that have taken, Senator?</i>

92
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,330
<i>There were a series of storms building
in Southeast Asia and the North Atlantic</i>

93
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,930
<i>that would have killed
tens of thousands of people.</i>

94
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,770
<i>Dutch Boy was ready. We went green.</i>

95
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,410
<i>It works. You're welcome.</i>

96
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,970
<i>Mr. Lawson, if you continue
to defy our authority...</i>

97
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,130
<i>Dutch Boy will go on without you!</i>

98
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,770
<i>Am I making myself clear?</i>

99
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,690
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,760
<i>Good. Oh, and one more thing.</i>

101
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,170
<i>To ensure compliance, this committee
will be sending up new support staff.</i>

102
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,650
<i>Naturally, when they get there, you'll
have to send some of your people home.</i>

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,900
<i>We'll leave those choices up to you.</i>

104
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,250
<i>Senator, respectfully,
my crew didn't do anything wrong.</i>

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,570
<i>Excuse me,
I'm not asking for your input.</i>

106
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,970
<i>These people left their homes
and their families</i>

107
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>and risked their lives
to save this planet.</i>

108
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,530
<i>This hearing is adjourned.</i>

109
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,970
<i>I'm not cutting a single one
of those people loose!</i>

110
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,130
<i>Excuse me?</i>

111
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,370
<i>People like you need people like me.
You know why?</i>

112
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,770
<i>So you can take credit
for everything we accomplish.</i>

113
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,970
<i>So you can go to your constituents
and your cronies...</i>

114
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,330
<i>This meeting is adjourned.</i>

115
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,340
<i>...and your mistresses
and puff out your chest</i>

116
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,050
<i>- and say, "Hey, look at me!"</i>
<i>- Sit down, please!</i>

117
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,010
<i>- Well, I'm looking, Senator.
- Excuse me.</i>

118
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,530
<i>- We're all looking.
- This meeting is adjourned.</i>

119
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,650
<i>This meeting is adjourned! Thank you.</i>

120
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,890
Well, that was going well, huh?

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,290
Up to a point.

122
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,890
No, Jake, that didn't go well
at any point.

123
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,490
But, hey, what are you good at,
little brother, huh?

124
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,490
Like working the angles,
smoothing ruffled feathers?

125
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,880
You can fix it. You always do.

126
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,210
It's like a talent.

127
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,170
It is a talent.

128
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,330
Of a sort.

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,530
I wish I could help you.
I really do.

130
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,130
But it's not that simple,

131
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,650
not this time.

132
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,450
Why not?

133
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,450
Well, as of last week,
they have put me in charge of Dutch Boy.

134
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,890
Well, that's great!

135
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,370
That's great! You kidding me?

136
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,930
You're kidding me.

137
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,020
Look, what do you want me to do? Huh?

138
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,850
You leave me no choice. I told you
this had to go well, and it didn't.

139
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,130
I'm sorry, Jake.

140
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,890
You're fired.

141
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,130
Jesus. It's over 120 in this mother.

142
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,530
Fan out.

143
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,690
Hi, Agent Wilson.

144
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,770
Assistant Secretary Lawson.

145
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,330
Oh, you look nice today.

146
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,770
I'm wearing the same thing
I always wear.

147
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,290
Not exactly.

148
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,250
Have you seen I, well, got on a new tie?

149
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,690
I observed. We're trained to notice
any disturbing details.

150
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,210
- Sarah, come on.
- Assistant Secretary Lawson...

151
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,180
I'm not permitted to engage in
casual conversation while I'm at a post.

152
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,610
We are being watched.

153
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,770
We're always being watched.

154
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,930
Well, if we're always being watched,
what's the point of hiding anything?

155
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,570
You're interfering with my duties.
I'd rather not shoot you.

156
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,660
Well, it would be an honor
to be the first person that you kill.

157
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,210
Hang on.

158
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,850
What is it?

159
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,700
Uh, the president's called
a security briefing.

160
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,690
It was not on the schedule,
so I guess I'm now on duty.

161
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,810
I like the tie. Home by 7:00. Love you.

162
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,810
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

163
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,930
I didn't say anything.

164
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,570
Move along, sir.

165
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,890
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,010
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

167
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,730
One of our thermospheric satellites

168
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,690
malfunctioned over Afghanistan.

169
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,570
<i>A UN recon team found it, Mr. President.</i>

170
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,850
And the members of the Climate Council,
they're aware?

171
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,050
Yes, and they've all agreed
to keep the incident discreet.

172
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,610
But with this many people in the loop,
I'm not sure how long it's gonna keep.

173
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,410
And we're sure this was caused
by Dutch Boy?

174
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,570
Absolutely.

175
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,090
Can we assume that this is
an isolated incident? Doctor Quigley?

176
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,410
We're fairly certain, yes.

177
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,010
It's great to know
that you're "fairly certain."

178
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,490
This is a serious malfunction.

179
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,980
So your proposal is what?

180
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,290
Simple. We shut down
all Central Asian satellites

181
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,680
<i>until we know what went wrong.</i>

182
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,170
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

183
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,010
Know how difficult it was to get every
one of these nations online for this?

184
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,650
<i>We have worked extremely hard</i>

185
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,450
to assure these nations that this
system will protect them, and it has.

186
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,330
And let's not forget, people,
it's an election year.

187
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,650
We shut Dutch Boy down,
the press is gonna jump all over this.

188
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,810
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

189
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,650
300 people died in that village.

190
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,090
I mean, who gives a damn
about the politics of it all?

191
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,970
Look, we cost those people their lives.

192
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,980
<i>The only thing we should be concerned
about here is how to fix it</i>

193
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,130
and making sure it never happens again.

194
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,330
And how do you propose we do that?

195
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,330
We can't do anything.

196
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,210
What I mean is, the problem is
not gonna be solved in this room

197
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,530
and, well, certainly not by us.

198
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,210
No, no, we need an international team
on the station itself.

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,650
You know, not suits.

200
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,450
<i>Engineers, coders, builders</i>

201
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,690
doing a comprehensive systems check,

202
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,010
no matter the cost,
no matter the politics,

203
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,010
and we need 'em up there now.

204
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,730
We are set to transfer full authority
for Dutch Boy

205
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>to the international community
in two weeks.</i>

206
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,210
I will not be the president
that hands over damaged goods.

207
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,780
Not now, not ever.

208
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,210
So we are gonna handle this problem
and its solution in-house,

209
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,260
and we are gonna send up one man.

210
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,930
One of our own, who reports only to us
and that we can control.

211
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,440
<i>Understood?</i>

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,260
So find me that someone.

213
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,050
Now.

214
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,780
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,810
Look, I know you're not gonna like it,
but as I see it,

216
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,330
there's only one person
to go after for this.

217
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,130
Your brother, Jake.

218
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,210
Come on, not Jake.

219
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,930
17 countries, hmm?

220
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,820
17 countries had teams working on
Dutch Boy. They all reported to him.

221
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,290
Nobody knows what's under the hood
better than him.

222
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,770
Come on. Can we weigh other options?

223
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,530
Max, how long have you known me?

224
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,410
Ever since I was transferred
to the State Department.

225
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,370
That's right. I handpicked you.

226
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,570
I believed in you. You're smart.

227
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,970
And I was right about you.

228
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,530
I'm right about Jake.

229
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,810
If this is gonna be a problem...

230
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,980
No, sir.

231
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,330
Good.

232
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,370
<i>Afghan satellite
zero-niner-six inbound.</i>

233
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,410
<i>All crews prepare for incoming
Afghanistan satellite.</i>

234
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,050
<i>Replacement satellite
standing by.</i>

235
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,570
<i>Afghan sat is locked in.</i>

236
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,690
Replacement cleared for launch.

237
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,170
<i>And away on sat 5-A.</i>

238
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,450
<i>Airlock doors secured.</i>

239
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,930
I want a full dissection
of all components.

240
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,090
Priority one.

241
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,370
<i>Afghan satellite dissection
commencing.</i>

242
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,050
I will take care of this.

243
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,010
Make sure they depressurize
the fuel intake.

244
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,130
Yeah, we got it, man.

245
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,660
Makmoud. Oi, Makmoud!

246
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm about to obliterate
your top score here, pal.

247
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,610
I have to do some reprogramming.

248
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,930
Oh, come on!

249
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,410
He's got no pride of ownership,
that lad.

250
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,090
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

251
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,970
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

252
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,440
Uncle Max?

253
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,890
Hey! What you doing up there?

254
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,170
<i>What is that? A solar generator?</i>

255
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,730
Dual axis sun-tracking solar generator.
Replacing the power converter.

256
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,250
Oh, God!

257
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,690
You're getting more like your dad
every day.

258
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,890
Hey, where'd he find that?

259
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,210
Are you seriously asking that question?

260
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,250
Oh, of course.

261
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,330
He made it, right? Come here, you.

262
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,370
Ah, it's good to see you!

263
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,050
How you doing? You okay?

264
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,290
I'm really great.

265
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,650
Okay, what's going on here?

266
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,620
All right, this is freaking me out.
You're supposed to be nine years old.

267
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,690
Thirteen.

268
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,170
You were supposed to be
a part of my life,

269
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,930
but shit happens.

270
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,170
Ouch!

271
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,050
So what's going on here?
You living with him now?

272
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,330
He gets me two weekends a month.

273
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,140
Oh, good. Well, how's your mom?

274
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,650
Hmm, justifiably pissed.

275
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,370
I bet.

276
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,090
<i>Hannah, it's time.</i>

277
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,490
What's up, Jake?

278
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,050
Hannah, I thought I told you not
to talk to strangers.

279
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,970
Come on. Don't listen to him.

280
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,730
Your dad and I were your age,

281
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,290
we were so close we had
our own secret code.

282
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,170
<i>- That's true.</i>
<i>- Really?</i>

283
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,090
I don't remember that.

284
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,090
Yeah, you do.

285
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,570
No, I don't.

286
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,570
Well, it was nice seeing you.

287
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,130
Hey, look, you take care.

288
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,930
What's with all the car parts?

289
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,330
I build electric motors
for the retirees down in Vero Beach.

290
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,810
Keeps me busy.

291
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,610
Seems hardly worth your talent.

292
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,010
<i>Kidding?</i>

293
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,580
Having the time of my life.

294
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,250
It's a little early, don't you think?

295
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,850
I got fired by my own brother.

296
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,570
Then I lost my family,

297
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,530
<i>my house, my dog,</i>

298
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,690
so happy hour
starts around 11:00 out here.

299
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,770
<i>Okay, saw your niece,
you don't want a beer.</i>

300
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,730
Road's that way.

301
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,010
There's something wrong with Dutch Boy.

302
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,050
No, there isn't.

303
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,730
Well, an entire village of
dead Afghans may disagree with you.

304
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,930
Yeah.

305
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,370
And then yesterday,
an airlock just opened by itself.

306
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,930
We lost one of our crew.

307
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,730
Dutch Boy is not my problem anymore.

308
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,380
That I am calling bullshit on.

309
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,010
'Cause other than your daughter
and your precious soccer club,

310
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,770
Dutch Boy was all
you ever gave a damn about.

311
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,170
Oh, yeah, once.

312
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,340
Yeah, but you took care of that.

313
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,850
You don't care?

314
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,170
No?

315
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,690
Well, then, what are you doing
living out here?

316
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,530
Hmm?

317
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,610
Look, I know you think I'm a weasel,

318
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,690
someone who just moves pieces
around a chessboard for a living.

319
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,130
Well, guess what, yeah. Yeah, I am.

320
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,490
But that is how you get 17 countries
to agree to build a space station.

321
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,300
Now, you build things, right?

322
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,410
And there is something wrong
with the thing that you built,

323
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,770
<i>and people are dying.</i>

324
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,770
If you really think you're the best,
which I know that you do,

325
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,650
then how the hell
can you stand there and say no?

326
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,600
I'll be taking orders from someone,
I suppose.

327
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,250
Yeah.

328
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,650
So what? Is that a yes?

329
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,290
Long as it's not you, yeah.

330
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,170
<i>Hey, this is Max.
Leave a message.</i>

331
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,540
You got any room in there for me?

332
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,450
Whoa!

333
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,130
Whoa!

334
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,970
Okay.

335
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,730
I think this is everything.

336
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,290
I made you a packed lunch as well.

337
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,930
Did you hear about the gas main
explosions in Hong Kong?

338
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,770
Yeah, it just hit the news.

339
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,050
It's terrible.

340
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,530
Was it anything like what happened
in Afghanistan?

341
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,730
No, nothing happened in Afghanistan.

342
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,560
Are you going back up to space?

343
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,690
- No.
- Yes, you are!

344
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,490
You're leaving today to fix Dutch Boy.

345
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,420
What did I tell you
about eavesdropping?

346
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,370
You've never told me anything
about eavesdropping.

347
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,170
You don't really do much parenting.

348
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,810
How do you know it's safe?

349
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,050
Of course it's safe.
I've been up there 100 times.

350
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,130
Don't treat me like I'm a child.
Someone died!

351
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,930
- It was an accident.
- Someone got sucked out!

352
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,890
It was an accident.

353
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,440
See, that's what I'm going up there
to fix, okay? You don't have to worry.

354
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,650
Hey, think of it like I'm going
on a vacation for a week or two.

355
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,370
To a place 250 miles straight up

356
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,850
and -450 degrees?

357
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,330
Some holiday.

358
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,810
Yeah, you got a point.

359
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,530
Why'd Uncle Max fire you?

360
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,690
Unbelievable!

361
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,810
Did you do something wrong?

362
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,210
No, look, your Uncle Max and me...

363
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,450
It's not just about the one job.

364
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,730
You know, sometimes,
younger brothers resent being younger.

365
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,850
So they get bossy.
They think they know everything.

366
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,170
They tell you how to act, how to talk,

367
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,050
and after a couple decades,
you just get tired of listening to it.

368
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,210
Maybe you should listen.

369
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,570
My lift is here.

370
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,730
- Gotta go.
- What?

371
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,650
Wait, I thought I was
taking you to the airport.

372
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,050
You really wanna see Mom? Great!

373
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,210
We can all fly home to Atlanta together.

374
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,970
Got it covered.

375
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,770
Quit acting like you're mad.

376
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,370
Hannah, what do you want from me?

377
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,810
I want you to come back alive.

378
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,330
And you're not exactly
the reliable type.

379
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,730
Hey.

380
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:44,170
I know I haven't always
kept good on my promises,

381
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,850
but I'm coming back.

382
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,610
- I--
- Promise.

383
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,380
I promise.

384
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,730
Come here.

385
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,450
I'll be back soon, okay?

386
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,370
<i>OV-104 is now at
T minus one hour and ready for boarding.</i>

387
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,330
<i>We're at T minus one minute
and counting.</i>

388
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,810
Have a safe trip, sir.

389
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,380
<i>Booster rocket
separation confirmed.</i>

390
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,490
Hate to interrupt, Major Tom,

391
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,930
<i>but in a few seconds,
you should be able to see the net.</i>

392
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,730
<i>How's it feel to be back home?</i>

393
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,770
Look at you, girl.

394
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,170
Livin' and breathin'.

395
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,690
Mr. Lawson.

396
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,130
Hey.

397
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,930
Ute Fassbinder.

398
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,330
Nice to meet you.

399
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,100
Yeah, I remember you.

400
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,930
Yeah, you were the German scientist.
You were here when I was here.

401
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,090
Thermospherics, right?

402
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,290
Yeah.

403
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,570
The containment shell needs
a fresh coat of sealant

404
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,200
where the APT ducts push
through the channel housing.

405
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,450
Not good. That's wrong.

406
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,610
And you hear that?

407
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,130
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Listen.

408
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,010
That wobbly hum?

409
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,490
That's a bad step-down transformer.

410
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,210
All these things,
they have to be watched, cared for.

411
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,090
- Mr. Lawson.
- No, I know. It's not your fault,

412
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,650
but when I left,
everything here was perfect.

413
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,930
I need to speak to your Chief Scientist
about the art of giving a shit.

414
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,450
I'm the Chief Scientist.
I've been promoted a year ago.

415
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,770
Right, congratulations.

416
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,570
One of our crew died this week,
Mr. Lawson.

417
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,690
Sorry about the transformer.

418
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,330
Let me introduce you to your team.

419
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,970
Oh, of course, an American.

420
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,290
Actually, my brother and I
were born in the UK, but thank you.

421
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,140
Yeah, but you've got the old
Stars and Stripes on your arm there,

422
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,090
<i>and a cowboy look in your eye.</i>

423
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,170
<i>Oh, no offense.
This is just a serious situation,</i>

424
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,250
and the last thing we need is some
Washington stooge to come supervise us.

425
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,410
Do we, lads?

426
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,730
Well, you got one,

427
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,050
so how about we start
with names and positions?

428
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,410
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,730
Adisa, structural.

430
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,330
Duncan Taylor, systems and OS analyst
and loyal British subject.

431
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,090
Hernandez, robotics.

432
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,650
Dussette.

433
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,610
Satcom and security.

434
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,890
And you are?

435
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,610
This is Mr. Jake Lawson.

436
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,050
You're Jake Lawson? The Jake Lawson?

437
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,650
You look much older
than I would've thought.

438
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,850
<i>I mean, you look good...</i>

439
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,530
...but your physical appearance is not,

440
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,290
does not match the amount of time
that has elapsed in your life.

441
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,450
Am I getting fired?

442
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,060
Okay, we don't have
a lot of time.

443
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,970
So we have three situations to examine.

444
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,490
Afghanistan, the scientist that died
here, and the new incident in Hong Kong.

445
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,570
Hong Kong?
No, that was a gas main explosion.

446
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,890
<i>We all watched that on the telly.</i>

447
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,330
All right, okay.
You just keep believing that.

448
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,090
<i>I, on the other hand,</i>

449
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,850
have a mystery that I'd like to solve
and prevent more deaths,

450
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,810
so feel free to join me.

451
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,890
Or not.

452
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,820
<i>All right, quick question.</i>

453
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,930
<i>Okay, active shooter,</i>

454
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,610
the president and I are both
in the line of fire.

455
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,410
Who do you save first? Me--

456
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,610
The president.

457
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,050
Oh, come on. You could take
a second just to think about that.

458
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,210
Sorry, baby.

459
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,970
Job comes first, same with you.

460
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,610
No, that's not true.

461
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,730
No, I have priorities and you,

462
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,840
you are my priority.

463
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,370
Come on, let's do it.

464
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,450
I kinda want to,

465
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,330
but you just keep talking.

466
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,810
I mean, why do we always
have to be sneaking around?

467
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,570
Come on, let's do it. Let's get married.

468
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,210
We can't.

469
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,290
It's against the rules.

470
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,610
One day, baby.

471
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,090
Um, you're gonna get that.

472
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,810
Because your job comes first.

473
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,890
No...

474
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,810
I'm gonna get it 'cause
I don't want it to interfere with this.

475
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,250
See?

476
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,890
Now I might just not save you.

477
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,970
Yeah, hello?

478
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,500
Max, it's Cheng.

479
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,460
Cheng, God, tell me
you're not in Hong Kong.

480
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,940
- Cheng?
<i>- Last night,</i>

481
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,290
I was right in the middle of it.
It was horrible. That's why I'm calling.

482
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,690
<i>Phone service just came back on.</i>

483
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,330
Yeah, well, you're lucky to be alive.

484
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,170
<i>- I mean, those gas pipes?</i>
- I'm not so sure that was the cause.

485
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,010
What do you mean? I don't follow.

486
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,370
<i>It was abnormally hot
before the pipes blew.</i>

487
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,290
The satellite sensor
should've recorded it, right?

488
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,240
I checked over a dozen times but I can't
access Dutch Boy's Hong Kong satellite.

489
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,330
My access has been blocked.

490
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,970
<i>Check your HoloFrame.</i>

491
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,330
I don't understand.
We both have clearance.

492
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,610
<i>Exactly.</i>

493
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,010
The only people that have authority to
block are in the building you work in.

494
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,010
Wait. What do you mean?

495
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,650
If someone is covering up
a system defect,

496
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,090
there's potential for critical failure
on a global scale.

497
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,410
<i>If Dutch Boy has a catastrophic failure,</i>

498
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,330
it can create something far worse than
the very thing we're trying to prevent,

499
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,690
<i>what we call a geostorm.</i>

500
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,210
What? Slow down, Cheng, all right?
A what?

501
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,680
A geostorm.

502
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,970
Simultaneous catastrophic weather events
triggered all over the globe.

503
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,890
<i>Once they pass a minimum threshold, the
storms will start causing new storms,</i>

504
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,700
<i>like a chain reaction,
until they merge together.</i>

505
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,290
It's gotta be a glitch.

506
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,210
<i>I'll give you a call
when I know something.</i>

507
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,650
All right. Thanks.

508
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,650
<i>These pipes had not been
well maintained or upgraded in years.</i>

509
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,970
Cheng thinks Hong Kong
has something to do with Dutch Boy.

510
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,610
You know, he's implying
some kind of cover-up.

511
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,930
I just got a text and POTUS
called a last-minute press briefing.

512
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,650
What, you can't stay?

513
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,690
Oh, when duty calls, duty calls.

514
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,490
"Neither rain nor snow
nor gloom of night," right?

515
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,370
Honey, that's the Postal Service.

516
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,370
We're the Secret Service.
Secret Service.

517
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,410
Oh, there's a difference?
Really?

518
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,380
I didn't know that.

519
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,810
<i>Grab his laptop. Let's go.</i>

520
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,410
So the satellite that went rogue
over Afghanistan, what type was that?

521
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,490
That's my fave, actually.
I call it a "rock 'n' roller."

522
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,210
Oh, the SR-22.

523
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,290
Uses sonic waves to slow
molecular movement causing cooling,

524
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,730
but, in that case, freezing. Why?

525
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,730
<i>We don't know.
We checked the satellite's hard drives,</i>

526
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,930
but the logs were wiped clean
by the malfunction.

527
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,010
All right. Let's pull up every
"rock 'n' roller" satellite we have

528
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,130
to see if we can find
any corruption in their logs.

529
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,050
Pull up every "rock 'n' roller"
in the net.

530
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,330
There's gotta be more than
1,000 of them.

531
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,210
Ah, 1,270, to be exact.

532
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,970
And we're gonna scan
each and every one of 'em.

533
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,610
Dana. Hey.

534
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,380
Hey. What are you doing here?

535
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,810
What do you mean,
"What am I doing here"?

536
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,650
I work here. I'm your boss.

537
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,650
Yeah, but what are you doing
down from Mount Olympus

538
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,570
and visiting me in Millennial Village?

539
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,410
Well, I have a bit of a favor
to ask you.

540
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,530
You're the best at what you do.

541
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,570
But I need you to keep this between us.

542
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,370
Okay.

543
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,090
I have a problem with my HoloFrame.

544
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,890
Do I look like a Genius Bar to you?

545
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,770
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here
defending the free world

546
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,610
against state operators
and cyberterrorists,

547
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,170
but Grandpa needs help fixing his phone.

548
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,530
I have a problem trying to get through
to satellite G-22 over Hong Kong.

549
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,450
So a satellite has a bad comm.
That happens.

550
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,450
No. No, not a satellite.

551
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,210
All of them.

552
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,650
Oh.

553
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,090
I am mildly intrigued. Stay.

554
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,210
Okay.

555
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,140
It looks like vanilla line disruption,

556
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,250
<i>bad server relay, or trunk failure,
or something.</i>

557
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,490
Are you still dating
that Secret Service chick?

558
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,770
What? No.

559
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,130
No, I'm not dating anyone.

560
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,890
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,890
<i>Wait, look. Oh, my God.</i>

562
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,250
Someone wanted to block your access
without you knowing it was intentional.

563
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,010
But this...

564
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,450
This is very intentional,
and it's very clever.

565
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,940
And I know what you're gonna say.

566
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,170
You're gonna say,
"Tell no one." And I won't.

567
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,810
But I didn't sign up to work here
so I could cubicle-squat 24/7.

568
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,660
So whatever is going on,
I want in on the action.

569
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,810
Well, let's hope there isn't any action.

570
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,640
And yeah,

571
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,850
tell no one.

572
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,290
Miss Fassbinder, we've just been given
a priority communication request.

573
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,970
From Climate Command?

574
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,250
The White House.

575
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,810
All right. So who are the yahoos in
Washington we gotta deal with on this?

576
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,970
<i>I guess I would be the head yahoo.</i>

577
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,610
Hello, guys.

578
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,450
<i>Max tells me you don't have
a high opinion of politicians.</i>

579
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,180
I didn't say that.

580
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,410
<i>Well, neither do I.</i>

581
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,490
<i>We went through hell getting
the world on board for this program.</i>

582
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,340
<i>We've come too far for it to fail.</i>

583
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,170
<i>You and I both understand
why we cannot let that happen.</i>

584
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,570
Yes, sir.

585
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,410
So if I find anything,
I'll report to you right away.

586
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,810
<i>Actually,
you'll be reporting to Max here.</i>

587
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,570
<i>Good luck.</i>

588
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,370
<i>Have at it.</i>

589
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,130
Thank you, sir.

590
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,690
I'll leave you two alone.
And if you need me, I'm in my office.

591
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,490
Thank you.

592
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,290
I'll be reporting to you?

593
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,530
You lied to me.

594
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,890
<i>Again.</i>

595
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,570
No, I just didn't answer
your ridiculous demand.

596
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,890
How do I switch this thing off?

597
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,930
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

598
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,140
<i>We've been having issues down here
accessing the Dutch Boy satcom.</i>

599
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,930
We have reason to believe that it...

600
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,090
Well, it may not be accidental.

601
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,290
Might not be accidental?

602
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,130
Well, I've been trying to access
the Hong Kong satellite.

603
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,370
I knew it. I knew it!

604
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,770
You think it's possible?

605
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,210
Yeah. It's possible.

606
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,610
But even if you could access
the Hong Kong satellite remotely,

607
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,890
you're not gonna get the logs you need.

608
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,770
No. We gotta pull that information
from the actual satellite up here.

609
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,010
Okay. I can authorize that.

610
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,730
I don't need your authorization
for anything.

611
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,010
I'm sure that's really scary for you,

612
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,970
but how about you just count on me
to do my job, and say thank you?

613
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,700
Oh, count on you.

614
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,970
<i>Remember the first time
I had to bail you out?</i>

615
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,970
Oh, God. Jesus Christ!

616
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,570
Yeah, it was just one week
after Mom and Dad died.

617
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,450
You got arrested for fighting. Hmm?

618
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,650
<i>That's when I realized that
despite everything I was going through,</i>

619
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,610
<i>I was gonna have
to be responsible for you.</i>

620
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,260
All right, you know what?
Fine. It is what it is.

621
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,650
<i>I guess I got no choice
but to count on you.</i>

622
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,810
But if you ever authorize anything
without my approval,

623
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,130
you'll be on the next shuttle home.

624
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,690
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

625
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,010
<i>Hong Kong satellite 022
inbound for examination.</i>

626
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,850
All right.

627
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,130
Let's take this thing apart
and find out what happened in Hong Kong.

628
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,640
Bring it down.

629
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,810
It should have come down by now.

630
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,770
<i>What is that?</i>

631
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,490
I have no idea.

632
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,250
- All right, shut it down.
- It's not responding.

633
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,410
<i>Jesus, Hernandez!</i>

634
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,570
Get down!

635
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,660
Get out of here! Go!

636
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,010
Somebody, open this door, now!

637
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,130
Watch out!

638
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,250
Shit!

639
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,570
All right, let's pick up
every single piece of this thing

640
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,300
and get it down to manufacturing.

641
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,130
Do you think we can retrieve
the logs from the hard drives?

642
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,290
<i>Well, the accident created
an electrical short</i>

643
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,330
<i>and fried all the drives.</i>

644
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,170
I mean, look at it. It's toast.

645
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,850
So we've lost all the drives
with possible corruption?

646
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,690
Not all of them.

647
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,610
<i>What do you mean?</i>

648
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,730
I was reviewing your video
of the accident that killed Makmoud.

649
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,540
Each of the panels that blew
has a drive inside.

650
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,410
And one of them got stuck
in the communication tower.

651
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,810
It looks like
the seal locks are still intact.

652
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,570
If we're lucky, the corrupted drive
will still be inside.

653
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,930
We gotta get that panel back.

654
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,370
Yeah, hello?

655
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,130
I just got into DC. We have to meet.

656
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,520
I figured it all out.

657
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,330
Meet me at 10:00 at the place across
the square where we used to have lunch.

658
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,410
<i>Back in college.</i>

659
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,890
All right. Yeah, I'll be there.

660
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,020
<i>Ready to decompress.</i>

661
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,930
All right. Door's open, kids.

662
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,930
You're clear to exit.

663
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,610
<i>Step across the gravity threshold
and follow me.</i>

664
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,730
<i>Let's just get the panel,
see what's on those drives.</i>

665
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,340
Okay.

666
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,610
<i>There's the panel.</i>

667
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,810
<i>Wait. Hold up.</i>

668
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,890
<i>We designed the tower
to have emergency de-rig ports</i>

669
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,290
<i>so the bars can be moved easily.</i>

670
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,850
<i>Control, the panel is secured.</i>

671
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,970
<i>Roger that.</i>

672
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,210
Come back now, kids. Come back.

673
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,690
<i>We're on our way back.</i>

674
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,610
<i>Jake, what's happening?</i>

675
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,850
<i>I don't know! I don't know!</i>

676
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,650
<i>Jake? Jake!</i>

677
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,090
<i>I can't control the damn suit!</i>

678
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,410
- What's going on?
- His suit is malfunctioning.

679
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,810
- Jake, do you read me?
- Duncan, tell him to cut it.

680
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,540
Jake, cut off the fuel intake.

681
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,250
<i>It's not responding!</i>

682
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,050
<i>Hang on, Jake.</i>

683
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,010
<i>I can't hold it.</i>

684
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,370
<i>Eject the pack. Eject the pack!</i>

685
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,970
Oh, Christ. We're gonna lose him.
We're gonna lose him!

686
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,490
Are you all right?

687
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,770
Yeah.

688
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,530
You got the drive?

689
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,130
<i>I grabbed it when I freed the panel.</i>

690
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,810
You smashed up a dozen comm links,
TCAS sensors...

691
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,850
I'm fine, thank you very much.

692
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,410
What happened out there?

693
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,810
Propulsion throttle locked up.

694
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,490
And you lost the door panel,
which means no drive codes.

695
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,410
Back to square one.

696
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,810
Great.

697
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,210
Why didn't you tell them
about the drive?

698
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,570
Because someone just tried to kill me.

699
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,170
I know my crew. I trust them.

700
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,090
You think you know them.

701
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,770
But someone doesn't want us
to see what's on this drive.

702
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,890
Jake,
there's no corruption here at all.

703
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,210
The doors weren't accidentally
blown off. They were programmed to.

704
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,730
- This wasn't a malfunction.
- No.

705
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,290
Someone intentionally killed Makmoud.

706
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,690
No doubt the same person that tampered
with the Hong Kong satellite.

707
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,530
The user logins have been wiped clean.

708
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,490
We have no digital fingerprints.

709
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,850
No. That's what they think.

710
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,410
Login records are synced back
to the mainframe.

711
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,650
Yeah, but that's the problem.

712
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,610
If they're deleted in one place,
they're deleted everywhere.

713
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,530
No, everywhere they know about.

714
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,970
When we built Dutch Boy,
we put in a locked off library.

715
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,370
Something that would track
and archive everything.

716
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,660
Our saboteur's login info
is gonna be in there.

717
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,850
Nope.

718
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,890
You've been locked out.

719
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,330
But by who?

720
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,090
The virtual conference room.

721
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,450
How many have access
to those transmissions?

722
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,930
Anyone with level three access
and above.

723
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,130
Dozens of people.

724
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,370
Max.

725
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,810
- Max.
- What?

726
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,810
Relax. He'll be here soon.

727
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,930
What, really? I seem nervous?

728
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,490
Just a little.

729
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,570
He's here.

730
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,250
He's here?

731
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,250
No! No!

732
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,050
Cheng! My God!

733
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,210
No!

734
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,290
This is Agent Wilson.
Yes, I need an ambulance right now.

735
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,900
- Dupont Circle.
<i>- Max...</i>

736
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,650
<i>Agent Wilson,
I have dispatched the ambulance.</i>

737
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,130
You got me. You got me.

738
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,290
I'm here. Look at me. Look at me.

739
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,410
Zeus. Zeus.

740
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,010
What?

741
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,410
<i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

742
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,450
Max? You okay?

743
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,570
They said it was urgent.
What is it?

744
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,330
Yeah. Um...

745
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,770
I wanted to apologize.

746
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,170
Apologize?

747
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,490
If you had any idea
what I just walked away from...

748
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,700
You're gonna drag me up here
just to apologize?

749
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,810
<i>All right. Fine.</i>

750
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,130
Apology accepted.

751
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,530
Hey, Max, we don't walk out
on each other.

752
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,090
That's the unspoken code
between brothers.

753
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,730
<i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i>

754
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,930
Yeah, he dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne.

755
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,800
Proof the Lawsons aren't fishermen.

756
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,370
<i>Four hours,</i>

757
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,570
the three of us didn't catch a thing.

758
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,370
I tried to sabotage Dad's reel
so we could leave.

759
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,970
That pin
at the highest part of the spool,

760
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,210
<i>pulled it so the level mechanism
would pop out.</i>

761
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,090
Of course, Dad was a government spy
his whole life, caught me red-handed.

762
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,250
"Trust me," he said.
"I get it. No one likes to fail.

763
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,440
<i>"But I'd rather not catch fish
with my family</i>

764
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,610
<i>"than catch 20 fish alone."</i>

765
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,330
I didn't even understand
what he meant back then.

766
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,890
But I do now.

767
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,810
<i>Take care, Max.</i>

768
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,610
End transmission.

769
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,090
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

770
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,450
What was all that?

771
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,490
That was the first decent conversation
we've had in years.

772
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,210
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

773
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,730
Would you relax?

774
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,890
What?

775
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,450
Do you have a moment?

776
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,330
Yes! I do. I got your message.

777
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,530
Jesus.

778
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,530
What happened?
Did Secret Service Barbie dump you?

779
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,690
I need to show you something.

780
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,850
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

781
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,880
<i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i>

782
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,770
<i>He dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne.</i>

783
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,330
Our dad never took us fishing.

784
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,930
Oh.

785
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,930
That's sad.

786
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

787
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,730
I'm not good at the, like,
"Talk about your daddy issues"

788
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,010
kind of friend thing. I just...

789
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,290
What? No, no, no...

790
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,730
It's a code.

791
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,690
"He dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne."

792
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,170
His cell phone number is the key.

793
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,810
Take a look at the digits.

794
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,820
Okay, you got your first number,
that's your first word.

795
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,170
Second number, nine,
you move on nine words.

796
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,210
- That's your second word.
- Mmm-hmm.

797
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,250
Third number, nine again.

798
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,250
Another nine, you move on. Then nine,
then two, then nine, then five,

799
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,370
and so on and so on until you get
an entirely different message.

800
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,130
Oh. So, who came up
with this encryption, a 12-year-old?

801
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,410
No. I was 13.

802
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,810
Okay.

803
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,250
So, one-nine-nine-nine,

804
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,490
<i>two-nine-five-five,</i>

805
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,370
eight-seven-one and go.

806
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,330
<i>Proof of sabotage at
the highest level of government.</i>

807
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,930
<i>Trust no one.</i>

808
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,850
Well, you said
you were looking for action.

809
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,250
Uh, yeah, but I mean, holy shit.

810
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,090
If you don't wanna take this any
further, I totally understand.

811
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,530
No. I do, I do. I just...

812
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,010
I do and I don't.

813
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,050
Kinda like going on a rollercoaster
or eating Chipotle.

814
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,530
What's our next move?

815
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,450
Okay. I need you to find anything
you can on a file named "Project Zeus."

816
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,650
"Project Zeus"?

817
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,850
Yeah.

818
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,770
Okay. Looks like we have ourselves
a bro-spiracy theory.

819
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,570
- Just run the damn search.
- Yeah.

820
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,130
Um...

821
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,340
I am getting a hit.

822
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,450
Um...

823
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,810
But it looks like it's double encrypted.
It's a little OCD.

824
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,290
Can you break it?

825
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,140
Yeah, I could,

826
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,170
but I can't do it from here.

827
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,090
The file's under a White House security
network, and it's just not hackable.

828
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,090
I'd have to log in,
and I don't have the credentials for it.

829
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,690
Shit. Neither do I.

830
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,130
I don't know anyone who does.

831
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,250
Yeah, you do.

832
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,570
Max?

833
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,250
Freeze.

834
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,690
Oh! Holy shit!

835
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Honey, relax!

836
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,460
Who is this girl in our house?

837
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,180
I can explain everything.

838
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,770
Mmm, that sounds really pervy.

839
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,380
- Shut up.
<i>- Okay, I'm sorry. I will.</i>

840
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,260
I broke one of your wine glasses. Um...

841
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,690
It just fell and I promise
I'm gonna reimburse you.

842
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,570
I have the money. I'm sorry.

843
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,770
Talk.

844
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,850
This is Dana.
She works with me in State.

845
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,370
Now, I asked her here
because I need her help,

846
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,410
and as it turns out,
I need your help, too.

847
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,730
She's hot!

848
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,930
<i>I know how much
your job means to you.</i>

849
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,330
I took an oath, Max.

850
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,210
We have rules.

851
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,940
Technically, you're not supposed
to be sleeping together either--

852
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,370
Dana.

853
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,450
You're asking me to commit a crime.

854
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,170
You're soliciting a Secret Service agent
to break into the White House server

855
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,130
<i>and illegally obtain files.</i>

856
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,090
And you thought I would say yes!

857
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,290
- I still think you're gonna say yes.
- Why?

858
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,610
Because I'm the one who's asking you.

859
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,570
And if I'm asking you,

860
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,770
well, then it must be important.

861
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,780
And you know that it's bigger
than you and me.

862
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,930
"You and I."

863
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,130
Shut up.

864
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,730
Sarah, please.

865
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,850
One time.

866
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,920
We need to play back the security
cameras without alerting anyone.

867
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,890
Someone killed Makmoud.

868
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,090
We find out why,
we know who's behind this.

869
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,020
But you can't access the cameras
without it being logged in.

870
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,130
That's why we're going to the back-up
server room.

871
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,850
You see? It comes in handy
that I built the place.

872
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,650
Yes, but I live here.

873
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,850
Show off.

874
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,290
Makmoud was prepping diagnostics
on the Afghan sat

875
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,060
while we launched a replacement.

876
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,130
Son of a bitch.

877
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,410
He pulled something off the sat.

878
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,330
Poor bastard figured it out,

879
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,250
and they killed him to make sure
no one else did.

880
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,010
<i>There are no cameras allowed
in the locker rooms.</i>

881
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,410
Then let's go take a look for ourselves.

882
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,210
181.

883
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,490
181.

884
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,890
What's the code?

885
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,860
Seven, six, three, six, three.

886
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,530
<i>What do you think
you're doing?</i>

887
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,650
You know what happened to me out there
wasn't an accident.

888
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,930
<i>Whoever did that</i>

889
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,450
killed Makmoud.

890
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,610
And what makes you think it is not me?

891
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,770
Because if it was you,
I'd be dead already.

892
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,730
Dussette, lower your gun.

893
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,090
Whatever you're looking for,

894
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,740
it is not in this locker.

895
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,090
I was here when Makmoud came in.

896
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,890
He put his stuff in an empty one.

897
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,370
Why didn't you tell me?

898
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,250
You watched the same
security footage as I did.

899
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,530
I was just waiting to see who was
gonna come and look for Makmoud's stuff.

900
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,290
It's in here.

901
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,130
<i>Two, six, six, five, three.</i>

902
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,410
Bingo.

903
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,650
This is everything he copied
off the satellite onto his HoloFrame.

904
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,090
<i>That's a virus.</i>

905
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,650
That wasn't generated by the satellite's
onboard computer.

906
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,410
Because they were planted.

907
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,770
Makmoud found the virus and got killed
before he could tell anyone.

908
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,450
<i>Oh, I got it.
All right, here we go.</i>

909
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,250
Project Zeus.

910
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,370
There are tens of thousands of
storm simulations in here,

911
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,450
and each one is starting
in a different place.

912
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,410
<i>They all end the same way.</i>

913
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,170
A geostorm.

914
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,770
I mean, unlike anything we've ever seen.

915
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,490
Dana, can you show us just the
simulation that begins in Afghanistan?

916
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,530
Yeah, sure.

917
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,530
<i>Okay, now filter those</i>

918
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,300
so that the second malfunction's
over Hong Kong.

919
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,770
Where are you going with this?

920
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,170
What if Cheng realized that someone
was following one of his scenarios?

921
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,970
You know, making it look like
a predicted pattern of malfunction,

922
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,840
disguising a crime
like a series of accidents.

923
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,250
It might actually be
a series of accidents.

924
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,770
If it were,
they wouldn't have killed him.

925
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,320
Someone has weaponized Dutch Boy.

926
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,850
<i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

927
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,010
<i>Hey.</i>

928
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,930
New face?

929
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,610
Yeah. A friend.

930
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,010
Uh, she's keeping things off
the monitor channels,

931
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,170
<i>so we're good.</i>

932
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,610
- So you got my message?
<i>- Yeah, I got your message.</i>

933
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,980
It's, uh... It's worse than we thought.

934
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,810
Whoever's doing this is using
Dutch Boy to target cities.

935
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,820
Yeah, they're disguising their moves
as malfunctions.

936
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,930
They already killed the man
who found out about this,

937
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,420
and I don't think they're done.

938
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,850
Yeah.

939
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,690
This was my life's work, Max.

940
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,650
You know, they said it was impossible,

941
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,890
but we pulled it off.

942
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,370
And it worked

943
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,650
perfectly, without fail,
day after day, year after year.

944
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,450
So what do people do with it?

945
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,260
Turn it into a gun.

946
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,410
<i>I know.</i>

947
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,170
<i>I know. It's not too late.
We can fix this</i>

948
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,980
before it happens again,
but I can't do it on my own.

949
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,010
I need you. I need you to tell me,
how are they controlling Dutch Boy?

950
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,770
- I know how they're controlling it.
<i>- How?</i>

951
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,330
A virus.

952
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,050
<i>Well, can you stop it?</i>

953
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,210
There's only one way.

954
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,130
We can shut down Dutch Boy temporarily.

955
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,090
The reboot will flush out the system,

956
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,820
kill the virus, and revert back
to the fail-safe OS.

957
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,650
Okay. Let's do it.

958
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,130
I'm authorizing.

959
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,530
Yeah, I think we've established
that I don't really wait for that.

960
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,690
This isn't a Chromebook.

961
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,450
You don't just put your finger
on the power button.

962
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,090
You need the kill codes.

963
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,210
And the only one who has those
is the president.

964
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,610
So let's just go to the president
and tell him what we know.

965
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,090
No. You can't go to Palma.

966
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,490
<i>We need way more proof than I have.</i>

967
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,170
We're talking about shutting down
Dutch Boy.

968
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,720
I mean, even for an hour,
that puts the whole planet at risk.

969
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,890
No, I don't think you understand.

970
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,250
Someone sealed off the backdoor
into the system.

971
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,610
A backdoor almost no one knew existed.

972
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,380
But the president did.

973
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,080
No. Jake, come on. What?

974
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,570
Are you out of your mind?

975
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,410
Not saying it's him. I'm saying,
"What if?"

976
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,610
Who else has the resources
to pull this off?

977
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,020
Murder, cover-up, a virus that can only
be stopped with the codes in his pocket.

978
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,330
Why? Huh? Tell me, why?
Why would he do that?

979
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,250
We're two weeks away from transferring
Dutch Boy to the rest of the world.

980
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,980
Two weeks away from losing
autonomous control.

981
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,450
Now, he talks a good game,
but he's never gonna let it happen.

982
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,330
A series of disasters,
an international crew to take the fall,

983
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,690
and he'll have to cancel the hand off.

984
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,610
And who would blame him?

985
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,370
All right. You stay on top
of your satellites.

986
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,410
Max.

987
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,330
Max, don't do anything stupid.

988
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,370
Let's go.

989
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,530
<i>Okay? They already
tried to kill me once.</i>

990
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,130
Max!

991
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,690
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

992
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,330
<i>President Palma,
a couple questions, please, sir.</i>

993
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,420
<i>Thoughts before you head to
the national convention in Orlando, sir?</i>

994
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,040
<i>Mr. President, do you care
to make a statement?</i>

995
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,410
<i>Mr. President, a moment
before you head to Orlando?</i>

996
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,610
My friends
from Washington, D.C.

997
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,930
<i>I could never get on a plane without
saying hello to you. It's impossible.</i>

998
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,410
What are you doing here?

999
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,490
- Are you insane?
- Sarah, look.

1000
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:39,210
Jake needs us to
steal the kill codes from Palma.

1001
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,290
Us?

1002
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,370
You're asking me to help you
on the word of your asshole brother,

1003
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,050
who you haven't even spoken to
for three years.

1004
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,890
Yeah.

1005
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:50,050
Think about it. Afghanistan, Hong Kong,
Cheng, the crazy sim shit,

1006
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,930
the death on the space station. Come on.

1007
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,050
Look, you gotta trust me on this,
all right? I'm not kidding around here.

1008
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,130
- Okay.
- Look.

1009
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,810
The codes are on Palma's HoloFrame.

1010
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,970
We can't do it on the plane.

1011
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:05,850
Why not?

1012
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,730
Too many eyes. He's never alone.

1013
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,730
All right, then what's the play?

1014
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:15,250
Palma wants some private time to shower
and make calls before the after-parties.

1015
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:16,650
You follow. I'll get you inside.

1016
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,530
I can steal the codes while he's
in the shower.

1017
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,610
- That's the idea.
- Yes, it is.

1018
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,810
<i>- Warning.</i>
- Out of the way.

1019
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,130
<i>All satellite communication offline.</i>

1020
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,610
<i>All satellite communication offline.
All crew report to stations immediately.</i>

1021
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,690
Oh, my God.

1022
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,810
We have nearly 200 satellites
reporting malfunctions,

1023
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,660
most of them nearing critical.

1024
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,770
Pull up the satellite closest to
critical overload.

1025
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,850
We've lost all control
of the Tokyo satellite.

1026
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,610
<i>Max.</i>

1027
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,250
I didn't know you were coming
to the convention.

1028
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,050
Yeah. You know,
my dad lives in Florida,

1029
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,930
so I promised I'd get him
into the convention.

1030
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:21,800
We need every vote, right?

1031
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,930
Yeah, well, bring him to the green room.
We'll do a little photo op.

1032
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,810
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
Thank you.

1033
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,850
We've got reports of extreme weather
anomalies building

1034
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,370
over Brazil, Mexico, Bucharest,
and Belgrade.

1035
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,200
There's over 1,000 storm warnings
issued around the world.

1036
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,170
<i>Rio de Janeiro satellite critical.</i>

1037
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,330
<i>Retrieval routine offline.</i>

1038
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,810
Chart a new course!

1039
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,290
Get us close to the nearest satellites
going critical.

1040
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,770
- What are you trying to do?
- We're gonna launch the replacements.

1041
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,090
- As many as we can, as fast as we can.
- Wait, wait, wait...

1042
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,290
We have to retrieve the other
satellites first.

1043
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,890
Or the replacements will crash
into them.

1044
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,370
They're programmed to arrive

1045
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,810
in the exact same destination.

1046
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,970
And they'll knock out
the infected satellites.

1047
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,280
- Yeah.
- Of course!

1048
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,130
<i>All crews report to stations</i>

1049
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,810
<i>for Rio satellite replacement.</i>

1050
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,730
<i>Go for launch.</i>

1051
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,450
Away she goes.

<i>Satellite replacement for Rio

<i>Warning. Satellite on collision course.</i>

1054
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,210
Disable the retro-boosters.

1055
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,570
Don't let it slow down.

1056
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,130
Load 'em up and keep 'em coming!

1057
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,940
<i>Warning. Geostorm alert.</i>

1059
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,490
Four more years!
Four more years!

1060
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,220
<i>Thank you. As you know,
the environment</i>

1061
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,920
<i>was my late wife's
great passion and purpose.</i>

1062
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,130
<i>And I know that she would be
extremely proud...</i>

1063
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,250
<i>Caused by
the worst hailstorm in recorded history.</i>

1064
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,050
<i>There has been another extreme weather
event, this time in Rio de Janeiro.</i>

1065
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:45,290
<i>An offshore cold front moved rapidly
across land,</i>

1066

<i>plunging the city into
dangerously low temperatures.</i>

1067
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,890
<i>There are reports
of numerous casualties,</i>

1068
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,210
<i>but we don't know how many at this time.</i>

1069
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,490
<i>We're also hearing that a cargo plane</i>

1070
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:57,610
<i>may have crashed in the city itself,
possibly related to the freezing cold.</i>

1071
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:01,610
<i>Tokyo and Rio are the first catastrophic
events since the launch of Dutch Boy.</i>

1072
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,770
<i>Stay tuned after the break, when we'll
be joined by our reporter Sally Jones.</i>

1073
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,050
Oh, God.

1074
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,330
<i>Hey, Max!</i>

1075
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:17,770
Where's your daddy?

1076
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,380
Oh. Uh...

1077
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,970
You know what? He got so caught up
in all the excitement.

1078
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,170
I recruited you for this position.

1079
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,690
I know everything about you.
Your brother, and your mother's death,

1080
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,290
your father's death, everything.

1081
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,970
Why'd you lie to me, hmm?
Why'd you insist on making this trip?

1082
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,640
Tell me what's wrong.

1083
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,810
Maybe I can help you, maybe I can't.

1084
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,090
All right, look.

1085
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,250
I gotta tell you something. Come here.

1086
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:50,700
We are 90 minutes away from
a global storm we won't recover from.

1087
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,890
And I need the president's kill codes.

1088
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:55,850
Come again?

1089
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,650
We gotta shut Dutch Boy down, now.

1090
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,010
You're serious.

1091
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,410
You say you hired me
because you believe in me, right?

1092
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,860
All right, well, I need you
to believe in me now.

1093
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,450
Well, we've gotta brief the president.
Get to Cape Canaveral.

1094
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,050
No, no, no. We can't do that, sir.

1095
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,090
Why not?

1096
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,450
I believe he's the one who initiated it.

1097
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,170
<i>United we stand.</i>

1098
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,290
<i>United we can.</i>

1099
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,090
Four more years! Four more years!

1100
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,900
You better be goddamn sure of yourself,
making accusations like that.

1101
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,370
With all due respect, we don't have time
to argue about this.

1102
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,690
Palma and I go way back.
Why would he do that? That's insane.

1103
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,970
Yeah, well, he's doing it.

1104
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,130
What's your proof?

1105
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,170
Yeah, I got proof.
Dozens of files, all right?

1106
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,290
In Project Zeus. It's all there.

1107
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,690
Well, we can't get the kill codes
from the president.

1108
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,170
Why not?

1109
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,810
Because the president is the kill codes.

1110
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,410
Biometrics. Ten fingerprints,
two retina scans.

1111
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,570
Well, what do we do?

1112
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,250
I'll have to reason with him.
We'll have to reason with him.

1113
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,490
Satellites are
going critical over Florida.

1114
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,050
Load a replacement sat, now.

1115
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:11,810
<i>Station
self-destruct sequence initiated.</i>

1116
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,050
<i>Phase one commencing now.</i>

1117
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,610
Okay. Shut that down!

1118
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,010
I can't. I'm locked out.

1119
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,930
We built in backdoor overrides.

1120
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,930
Yeah, I'm trying them.

1121
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,810
<i>If we lose the station, we won't be able
to control the satellites.</i>

1122
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:26,810
Self-destruct?

1123
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,490
Why would you build that
into the station?

1124
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,370
In case it fell to Earth.

1125
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,850
Where's Duncan?

1126
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,410
He's the one with enough programming
expertise to override the commands.

1127
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,250
Duncan.

1128
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,290
<i>That's the fuel tanks.</i>

1129
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:48,570
They're the first to go.

1130
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:51,050
Then section by section
until command and retrieval.

1131
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,130
Okay, everybody, get to the shuttles!

1132
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,050
<i>Evacuate!</i>

1133
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,410
Come on, we gotta hurry! Go, go, go!

1134
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,930
Jake, what are you still doing here?

1135
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,770
That felt good.

1136
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,170
Been wanting to do that
since I first met you.

1137
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,530
Have you gone mad?

1138
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,730
Yeah, pretty much.

1139
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,340
The virus.

1140
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,880
You're the only one that could have
put it in the system.

1141
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,050
You're the only one who could've
sealed off the backdoor.

1142
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,490
The only one that could've helped
to pull this off.

1143
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:29,530
I need the overrides for the
self-destruct to the station, now!

1144
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:30,930
I mean, what for?

1145
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,770
I'm not gonna be here when it blows.

1146
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,970
But you will.

1147
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,410
Come on, man. Why'd you do it?

1148
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:43,620
Well, you know what us
lowly scientists get paid?

1149
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,130
Take that times 1,000.

1150
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,370
What difference is it gonna make?

1151
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,890
If you don't stop, there's not gonna be
a planet to spend it on.

1152
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,680
Please. We're gonna keep
all the best bits.

1153
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,970
Aren't you a little bit curious
to watch the world burn?

1154
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,610
No. 'Cause millions of people
are gonna die.

1155
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,570
And one of them's my daughter.

1156
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,010
Oh, shit.

1157
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,970
Holding room for the president
down on the left.

1158
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,370
We'll confront him there.

1159
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,090
Project Zeus.

1160
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,250
Did Cheng tell you anything else?

1161
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,490
Cheng?

1162
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:09,010
<i>But this president
knows that hope is not a plan.</i>

1163
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,490
<i>This president knows</i>

1164
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,260
<i>that despite how far we've come,</i>

1165
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,450
<i>there is much more work ahead.</i>

1166
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,210
<i>Working to save our planet</i>

1167
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,290
<i>is my first priority as vice president.</i>

1168
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,610
<i>This is but a stepping stone
to the success</i>

1169
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:30,450
<i>and greatness that can and will be
the future of our society.</i>

1170
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,410
Excuse me.

1171
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,380
<i>That's why I'm here tonight with
the Speaker of the House,</i>

1172
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,130
<i>the Senate pro tempore,
and President Palma's whole cabinet.</i>

1173
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,370
<i>We all stand united in support...</i>

1174
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,850
Palma doesn't leave the building.

1175
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,440
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

1176
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,210
Where have you been?

1177
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,850
Come here.

1178
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,050
It's not the president, all right?
It's Dekkom.

1179
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,170
Dekkom? How do you know?

1180
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,410
Because he just tried to kill me.
That's how I know.

1181
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:01,130
Look, the sim shows Orlando
is the next city to be hit.

1182
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,330
Here? Why would he do that?

1183
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,330
Because Dekkom wants Palma
trapped here, all right?

1184
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,610
And everyone else who's next in line
for the presidency.

1185
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,930
Are we still stealing the codes?

1186
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:15,890
The president is the kill codes,
all right? They're biometric.

1187
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,290
If Palma dies,
Dutch Boy can't be stopped.

1188
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,850
Sure, kidnap the president.
That sounds like the reasonable move.

1189
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,610
Yeah, well,
it's the only move we've got.

1190
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,570
Unless you wanna steal his fingers
and his eyes.

1191
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,730
Huh?

1192
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,660
We go now.

1193
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,250
You get us a car.

1194
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,410
I'll get us a president.

1195
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,090
All right, good.

1196
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,730
<i>The program did not gain</i>

1197
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,850
<i>the immense
international support that it...</i>

1198
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:48,330
Gunman spotted. POTUS is compromised.
Evac to secure location Alpha.

1199
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:50,850
Get him out, get him out!

1200
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,690
Go, go, go.

1201
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,890
Secret Service! Get back! Get back!

1202
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,330
You got a 20 on the shooters?

1203
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,060
Front mezzanine by exit 212!
Two men with automatics!

1204
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,540
- I'm on it! You get POTUS!
- You two,

1205
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,330
secure this entrance!
No one comes down this hallway!

1206
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,530
Nobody gets through! Hard room, Lammy.

1207
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,610
- Got it!
- You two,

1208
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,260
clear the emergency exit now!

1209
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:32,930
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1210
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,050
You need to come with me.

1211
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,290
<i>This exit is off limits!</i>

1212
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,330
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

1213
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,090
Seriously? A self-driving cab?

1214
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,490
Dana jacked it remotely.
It was all I could get.

1215
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:49,850
What the hell's going on here, Lawson?

1216
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,370
Please, sir. Look, I'll explain
everything in the car.

1217
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,010
Please, sir! We don't have much time!

1218
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,770
Keep moving! Get to the shuttles!

1219
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,450
Keep going!

1220
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,810
Quick!

1221
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,770
<i>Time to geostorm, 55 minutes.</i>

1222
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,970
Sir, I can barely hear you.
The storm is causing too much static.

1223
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,740
<i>The Secret Service
will be homing in</i>

1224
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,850
<i>on the beacon
on the president's HoloFrame.</i>

1225
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,620
You have got to get to him
before they do.

1226
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,810
Under no circumstances can he make it
out of Orlando.

1227
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,770
<i>Our man on the space station
did his job.</i>

1228
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,970
<i>- Now you do yours.</i>
- Copy that. Got it.

1229
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,010
- Dekkom?
<i>- It's the perfect weapon, sir.</i>

1230
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,650
All right, Dekkom is trying to change
the map of the world.

1231
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,410
And what? Blame it on a computer glitch?

1232
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,730
Yeah, well, that and a dead president.

1233
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,800
He'll take office after wiping out
everyone in the line of succession.

1234
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,730
Dear God.

1235
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,850
- Get to cover! Under the bridge.
- Sir.

1236
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,290
You are implicating
the Secretary of State in this.

1237
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,770
Do you realize you're committing--

1238
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,770
Treason. Oh, yeah.
I kidnapped the president.

1239
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,290
I've stolen state secrets.
Anything I'm forgetting, honey?

1240
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,090
Honey?

1241
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,650
Guilty.

1242
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,690
It took years
for Dekkom to plan this, sir.

1243
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,650
A president's schedule
always changes last minute.

1244
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,970
This is the one day and date
he could be sure wouldn't move.

1245
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,090
Having my brother and I

1246
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,330
lead the investigation
was a setup from the start.

1247
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,570
Think about it.

1248
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,330
He hired us to fail.

1249
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:00,930
Get down!

1250
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,090
All right, it's saying
we're back in the clear,

1251
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,330
<i>where the four meets the 91!</i>

1252
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,170
Just gotta take care
of a little problem first.

1253
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,620
Hold on!

1254
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,730
No!

1255
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,290
Marry her.

1256
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,290
No. We're fine here.

1257
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,570
<i>A lightning storm in Orlando</i>

1258
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,970
<i>has caused a horrific explosion
at the DNC.</i>

1259
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,770
<i>There is no official word
on the whereabouts of the president...</i>

1260
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,890
I don't know. I don't know.

1261
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,210
I just can't get in touch
with Jake.

1262
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,450
<i>And we have reports now of explosions
on the space station.</i>

1263
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:20,090
Honey, the Orlando storm is getting
really close to your dad's place.

1264
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:23,890
I can't get through to him.
Has he texted you?

1265
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,130
He's not there.

1266
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,050
He's there.

1267
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,250
<i>Of a major issue on the space station.</i>

1268
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,170
<i>Attention all crews.
Now loading final shuttle.</i>

1269
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:51,290
<i>Please board your designated
evacuation shuttles immediately.</i>

1270
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,250
<i>Shuttle launch sequence initiated.</i>

1271
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,090
Jake.

1272
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:58,410
- I'm not coming.
- What?

1273
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,850
When my brother gets those kill codes,

1274
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,370
someone has to be here
to execute the program.

1275
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,810
No. We need to go.

1276
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,300
We haven't heard from him in hours.

1277
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,610
I trust him.

1278
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,450
You know the reboot
has to be done manually.

1279
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,930
Then I stay. I'm the commander.

1280
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:12,210
No.

1281
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,610
I'm the only one my brother
will trust with the codes,

1282
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,040
so I need your HoloFrame.

1283
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,290
You have to insert it manually
at the core of the mainframe.

1284
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,450
You can find it, yes?

1285
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,290
- Yes.
- Good.

1286
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,290
Goodbye, Ute.

1287
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,050
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> Jake.

1288
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,770
<i>Pull over here.</i>

1289
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,570
The president's beacon shows him
heading right towards us.

1290
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,690
You really wanna drive back into that?

1291
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,170
Yeah, right after it passes,
I'll be the sole survivor,

1292
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,930
ready to be sworn in as
the next President of the United States.

1293
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,540
Here they come.

1294
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,170
Fire.

1295
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,100
You thought the president was the only
one who could be tracked?

1296
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:07,660
- How in hell did you--
- How?

1297
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,610
Because I'm the goddamn President
of the United States of America.

1298
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,490
You're done, Leonard.

1299
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,650
He's all yours.

1300
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,050
Wait, wait! Wait a minute.

1301
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,410
I've given you an opportunity,
Mr. President.

1302
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,100
You should take it.

1303
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,770
An opportunity? Let him go!

1304
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,970
It's genocide, Leonard!

1305
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,980
You say genocide,
I say preemptive strike.

1306
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,410
You've lost your mind!

1307
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,420
Tomorrow the sun will rise.
All our enemies will be gone.

1308
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,330
Wiped away as if by the hand of God.

1309
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,650
Why would you do this?

1310
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,690
Because no one else would.

1311
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,890
I'm turning the clock back to 1945,

1312
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:57,450
when America was a shining city on a
hill, not a bank disguised as a country.

1313
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:58,970
By playing God?

1314
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,650
What the hell is Dutch Boy
if not playing God?

1315
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,570
Ask Max. He knows.

1316
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,610
Science is all about playing God.

1317
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,130
Sometimes God doesn't play so nice.

1318
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,850
Yeah, well,
you know what my brother would say?

1319
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:11,890
What?

1320
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,210
Get him outta here!

1321
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:23,570
Let's go, Lawson!

1322
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,730
That's my fiancé.

1323
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,690
Get the president to cover! Hurry!

1324
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,970
Mr. President.

1325
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,090
We got the kill codes.

1326
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,250
You'll have to hurry.
The station is in full shutdown.

1327
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,530
What about the crew?

1328
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:40,730
Safe.

1329
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,810
But Jake decided to stay.

1330
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,050
To reboot the satellites.

1331
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,610
Your brother is waiting for you.

1332
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,730
Come on.

1333
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,020
<i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

1334
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,290
Hey.

1335
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,610
<i>Jake.</i>

1336
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,490
<i>Jake, it was Dekkom.</i>

1337
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,410
Well, I did say I might be wrong.

1338
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,210
<i>Mr. President.</i>

1339
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,130
How's Hannah?

1340
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,410
Oh, she's good. She's safe.

1341
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,920
<i>Atlanta wasn't hit.</i>

1342
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,610
<i>Thank God.</i>

1343
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:18,050
<i>Identity verified.
Shutdown protocol transfer initiating.</i>

1344
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,850
It's gonna take 60 seconds to upload.

1345
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,690
How long till the self-destruct?

1346
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,130
Eight minutes,

1347
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,610
give or take.

1348
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:25,850
<i>Mr. Lawson,</i>

1349
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,090
<i>we thank you for your sacrifice.</i>

1350
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,690
<i>Wait. What the hell's going on?</i>

1351
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,330
You've done your part, Max.

1352
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,810
Jake, what is going on?

1353
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,410
Now it's time for me to do mine.

1354
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,170
No, no, no.

1355
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,850
The kill codes don't stop
the self-destruct, do they?

1356
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,490
Do they?

1357
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:53,690
No,

1358
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,290
only the geostorm.

1359
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:58,090
The station self-destruct
can't be reversed.

1360
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,180
Come on, come on.
There must be a way, huh?

1361
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,210
Come on. It's all my fault.
I'm the one who put you up there!

1362
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,330
Hey, it's okay.

1363
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,250
I wanted to go. It was my choice.

1364
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,970
God knows,

1365
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,970
I haven't always made the right ones.

1366
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,330
You know, you were right,
little brother.

1367
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,210
I was supposed to look after you.

1368
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,130
But you looked after me.

1369
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:35,890
Can you forgive me?

1370
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,320
Yeah, always.

1371
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,170
Look after my little girl.

1372
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,500
Stay in her life.

1373
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,330
I will.

1374
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,330
We should've done this
a long time ago, huh?

1375
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,890
Yeah.

1376
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,000
You're a good man, Jake.

1377
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,650
I'll see you, kiddo.

1378
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,010
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

1379
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:13,900
<i>Time to geostorm: 5 minutes, 51 seconds.</i>

1380
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,370
<i>Warning. Core rotation has terminated.</i>

1381
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,570
<i>We don't know
what's happening up there.</i>

1382
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,770
<i>We just know the station has suffered
a devastating accident of some kind.</i>

1383
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:52,330
<i>We're being told now
it is beyond repair or salvation.</i>

1384
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,370
Honey.

1385
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,970
He's coming back.

1386
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,410
He promised me.

1387
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:01,530
<i>We will keep you updated
with any new developments.</i>

1388
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:25,650
<i>Self-destruct entering phase four.</i>

1389
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,330
<i>Code invalid.</i>

1390
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:46,890
<i>Code invalid.</i>

1391
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:49,290
<i>Need a hand?</i>

1392
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:55,370
<i>Wrong door.</i>

1393
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,010
<i>What're you doing here?</i>

1394
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,530
<i>I told you. I live here.</i>

1395
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:19,410
<i>Time to geostorm: 1 minute, 40 seconds.</i>

1396
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,850
<i>Uploading kill codes.</i>

1397
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:54,050
<i>Satellite shutdown in process.</i>

1398
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,570
<i>When the last satellite
cycles down, let me know.</i>

1399
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,780
<i>I'll manually reboot the entire system.</i>

1400
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:06,850
<i>- That should flush out the virus.
- Okay.</i>

1401
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:30,650
<i>Five to go.</i>

1402
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,330
<i>Three.</i>

1403
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,970
<i>- Come on, baby.
- Two.</i>

1404
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,610
<i>And one.</i>

1405
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,090
<i>Manual reboot activated.</i>

1406
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,890
<i>Status: rebooting.</i>

1407
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,730
<i>The net is back up.
The virus is gone.</i>

1408
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:17,170
<i>Transferring control of the net
back to NASA.</i>

1409
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,610
<i>Jake!</i>

1410
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,850
<i>I've got you!</i>

1411
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:46,010
<i>Warning.
Self-destruct entering final stage.</i>

1412
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:55,690
<i>Best seat in the house.</i>

1413
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,090
<i>Ute,</i>

1414
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,250
<i>do you believe in a Hail Mary?</i>

1415
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:15,730
<i>Follow me. We gotta get
to the satellite.</i>

1416
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,290
<i>I've got you.</i>

1417
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,730
<i>We've gotta get away as far as we can
before the final detonation.</i>

1418
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,170
<i>Dock releasing.</i>

1419
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:50,290
<i>And it appears
we have lost the space station.</i>

1420
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,730
<i>A tragic ending
for the two heroes still aboard.</i>

1421
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,290
<i>Hey, Max, take a look.</i>

1422
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,690
I'm picking up exhaust flares,

1423
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:19,250
<i>and they're pulsing in a Mayday pattern.</i>

1424
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,930
See if we can turn
one of the shuttles around.

1425
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,050
<i>Hopefully, someone sees this.</i>

1426
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,380
<i>Fingers crossed.</i>

1427
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,610
<i>Hernandez, you son of a bitch!</i>

1428
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:24,410
<i>Thank the Mexican.</i>

1429
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:44,970
Yes! Come here. Yes!

1430
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,940
<i>A miracle indeed.</i>

1431
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,170
<i>The shuttle you see is bringing home
all the ISS crew members</i>

1432
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:24,810
<i>who remained on the station.</i>

1433
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:43,010
Hi, Jake. I'm Sarah, Max's fiancée.

1434
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,170
Oh, welcome to the family.

1435
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,610
Well done, well done, both of you.

1436
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,250
Sorry I doubted you, Mr. President.

1437
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,220
Yeah, well, you were wrong, Jake, again.

1438
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:55,610
Well, how many times
do I have to tell you?

1439
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,130
Never listen to me.

1440
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,450
God, it's good to have you back, man.

1441
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,930
Good to be back.

1442
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,690
It's a nice place
you got here, Jake.

1443
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,570
Thank you.

1444
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:41,620
So when you heading back up?

1445
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,040
- In a week.
- Yeah?

1446
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,140
Yeah, a lot of work left.

1447
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:48,890
But I'll be back.

1448
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,850
I know.

1449
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,810
- This sucks.
- Yeah, seriously, this is so boring.

1450
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,930
You know what?
I can't do this for another second.

1451
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,850
Now, why'd you make us do this
in the first place?

1452
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,850
I don't know.
I was trying to relive a moment.

1453
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,690
A moment? What moment?

1454
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,730
We never went fishing with Dad.
You made that whole story up.

1455
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,570
Yeah, but that was a good story,
though, huh?

1456
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:18,160
I mean, you gotta give me that.

1457
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,050
I mean, it had a moral and everything.

1458
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,050
Moral? What moral?

1459
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,730
<i>You can't undo the past.</i>

1460
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:29,930
<i>All you can do is face what's ahead.</i>

1461
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:34,010
<i>NASA maintained the satellites
while we rebuilt the space station.</i>

1462
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:39,330
<i>We made it safer, made it stronger.
It belongs to all of us now.</i>

1463
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:41,850
<i>One planet, one people.</i>

1464
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:47,850
<i>And as long as we remember that
we share one future, we will survive.</i>
